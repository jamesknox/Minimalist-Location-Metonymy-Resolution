Israel<SEP>The influx of cheap Arab labour from the occupied territories allowed the Israeli economy to expand rapidly after 1967, pushing unskilled Jewish labour into higher grade work. The shift in the labour pattern significantly reduced the tensions between the European and non-European and largely unskilled Jewish elements in Israel which during the 1960s was becoming a serious social and political issue since the latter grew faster demographically than the former. Overall, <ENT>Israel<ENT>'s absorption of over 100,000 Palestinians as casual labourers created a feeling of weakness and helplessness in the Palestinian community, and of success and power within the Israeli economy. Since the territories were captive, Israel could develop them as its second largest export market (after the United States), with an export value of $800 million annually by 1986. 
Britain<SEP>I'd be somewhat hopeful we might get something on it. " If that's all we get, British industry won't be terribly happy about it. ACT is discriminatory, and it discriminates against the kind of companies that generally speaking are good for <ENT>Britain<ENT> Michael Heseltine: Talking to the Chancellor 
Zimbabwe<SEP>This time Zimbabwe made the most of it, and midway through the half wing Victor Olonga pounced for a try. That came after full-back Mike Rayer had dropped a huge up and under from Craig Brown beneath his posts and Olonga just won the touch ahead of Hill. The final quarter was virtually all <ENT>Zimbabwe<ENT>, although lock Phil Davies was able to charge through for Wales' fourth try seven minutes from time, which Jenkins again converted. 
US<SEP>Go back and think again, they said, this time with the emphasis on energy efficiency and renewables. He won't, of course; as an oil man, he probably can't. But it's encouraging that so many scientists, politicians and (of late) influential business people have been making it unmistakably clear to White House officials that the <ENT>US<ENT> position on global warming and the whole Earth Summit process absolutely stinks. There's really not much point advocating a ` New World Order " if there's no world left in which to establish that order. 
Argentina<SEP>Already, the Scots have seen Australia at close quarters in last week's Canberra Tournament, where the Wallabies reached the semi-final, while, earlier in the season, they faced a number of possible participants in the colours of Queensland in Dubai. This week, in the inaugural Fiji International Sevens, the Scots will be able to devote further studies to the Australians and get their first glimpse of Tonga, against whom they are also drawn in the Hong Kong Sevens. The trip to the colony next week will enable them to do their homework, too, on <ENT>Argentina<ENT> and Italy. Thus only Taiwan from the Scots' pool for the Murrayfield event will not be seen in the flesh, although Scotland's sevens coaches, Douglas Morgan and John Jeffrey, will doubtless seek videotape of the tournament in Sicily last summer from which the Taiwanese qualified. 
Albania<SEP>Group of 24 meeting Representatives of the Group of 24 (G-24) industrialized countries, which co-ordinated aid for eastern Europe and former Soviet Asia, met in the Albanian capital, Tirana, on July 22 in order to discuss with the Albanian authorities and international financial institutions how aid to Albania might be accelerated. The G-24 group expressed readiness to provide <ENT>Albania<ENT> with food aid until the 1993 harvest, and beyond if necessary. Italy was a major donor among European countries and Greece announced that it would make available US$70,000,000 for agricultural development, which was given high priority. 
Sudan<SEP>(And when they reappeared on screen, another wave of the plastic wands did the trick again.) What no one had to do in all this was think. It didn't occur to the purchaser of the pure cotton Live Aid souvenir tee-shirt to ponder the fact that the <ENT>Sudan<ENT> provides a huge amount of the raw cotton demanded by the cheap tee-shirt industry, yet millions of Sudanese citizens have never had a square meal in their lives. It is this attitude of institutionalized and traditional myopia that could lead to an annual monster Aid event, and the continuance, in slightly altered guise, of the Third World as helpless victim that we know and understand. 
Britain<SEP>Written by MIT Professor Paul Krugman, formerly on the staff of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Professor Edward Graham, formerly in the office of international investment at the US Treasury, and later at the OECD in Paris, the report will be scanned carefully as indicating the current thinking of the Washington policy-making establishment. ` Much public attention has been focused on foreign puchases of real estate, however, foreign ownership of banking and manufacturing is much more important ", the report argues. And while the bulk of public controversy has focused on Japanese investment, <ENT>Britain<ENT> plays by far the biggest role, accounting for 31 per cent of all foreign investment in the US, as much as the next two investors, the Dutch (14.9 per cent) and the Japanese (16.1 per cent) combined. Britain's eminence is likely to be brief. 
Austria<SEP>The year 1848 had demonstrated that she was unable to control the territory which was hers already. In the long run, collaboration with Russia would have turned her into Russia's vassal. The tsar was wrong to think that he could rely on payment for the help he had given <ENT>Austria<ENT> in 1849. " Was not Schwarzenberg himself [ the Austrian first minister who died in 1852 ] alleged to have declared that Austria would one day astound the world by the greatness of her ingratitude? " 
Britain<SEP>France, however, realized that her good relations with Egypt would suffer and her influence in the Levant diminish if she participated in an international move to force Mehemet Ali's withdrawal from Syria. The powers' united front broke down and the crisis lasted two years. <ENT>Britain<ENT> believed that she came out of it very well. Undaunted by French bluster, she took Beirut and Acre in 1840 and played the major part in obliging the Egyptians to return home. 
Italy<SEP>Meanwhile, the Irish Junior Three Day Event Team has plummeted to fifth position after speed and endurance at the Coca Cola Junior European three-day event championship held at Loughanmore, Templepatrick this weekend. The Irish team was lying second to Germany following Friday's dressage but a fall on cross country by Karen Connelly to incur 60 penalties and a refusal by Sasha Harrison which cost them 20 penalties sent them out of the reckoning. The team championship now stands after speed and endurance - 1, (Germany) 164.40; 2, (Great Britain) 164.80; 3, (<ENT>Italy<ENT>) 169.40; 4, (France) 208.20; 5, (Ireland) 219.80; 6, (Spain) 412.40. Caroline Spickhoff from Germany and Sweetgirl remains in first position in the junior individual championship. 
West Germany<SEP>` We are and will remain one nation. Step by small step we will find our way to a common solution, " he told a crowd of some 20,000 Berliners outside the Schoneberg Rathaus, the seat of West Berlin's government. This morning in Bonn, Dr Kohl will preside at an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss how <ENT>West Germany<ENT> should respond to the events of recent days. His forthright emphasis on unity yesterday came as East Germany's bewildered and beleaguered leaders announced new reforms and a fresh round of sackings from the ruling politburo yesterday, coupled with a public promise of free elections. 
Spain<SEP>The Commission on Oct. 13 barred a French industrial consortium led by the steel manufacturer Pechiney from accepting a state offer of cut-price electricity. On Nov. 15 it ordered the French car group Renault to repay some F 12,000 million (approximately equivalent to USdollars 1,900 million as Nov. 13, 1989) of state aid received since 1988, having already demanded the repayment of F 111,200,000 from the Peugeot group in respect of a cheap credit deal. Meanwhile pressure was increased on West Germany and <ENT>Spain<ENT> to stop state aid to car manufacturers, and on Italy in particular to desist from its heavy subsidies to numerous industries. Brittan also said in early December that he was to look into the UK government's award of some pounds 38,000,000 of secret financial inducements to British Aerospace, at the time of its purchase of the Rover car group in September 1988. 
Turkey<SEP>Turkey had in 1990 extended export credits to all three countries. Relations with EC <ENT>Turkey<ENT>'s application for full membership of the European Communities (EC) remained deferred for consideration in 1993. Ã–zal's proposal for a customs union with the EC by 1995 received EC endorsement in a formal communication issued in Brussels on June 6, 1990. 
UK<SEP>This definition of deindustrialization is concerned with the ability of the economy to produce a socially acceptable level of employment (full employment) in a context where the unemployment level is itself a product of government regulations about definitions and individuals' propensity to register. Secondly, given this definition, why in so much discussion of deindustrialization is the emphasis placed on manufacturing? In considering this question, Rhodes relates it specifically to the case of the <ENT>UK<ENT>: ` prominence is given to manufacturing only because Britain, as most other advanced countries, has relied heavily on manufacturing activities as a source of net exports and employment " (1986, p. 139). This raises the question whether, if manufacturing industry is collapsing, that implies the collapse of the UK economy. 
San Marino<SEP>Now England can go top of the group if they beat Turkey by four clear goals in Izmir next month. The Dutch, like England at Wembley last month, struggled at times to break through against a side reduced to ten men for the last half-hour after William Guerra was sent off. Midfielder John van den Brom scored after only two minutes but the Netherlands needed a 29th-minute own goal from <ENT>San Marino<ENT> defender Claudio Canti to take a 2-0 half-time lead. However, John de Wolf made it 3-0 after 52 minutes and from then San Marino were in total disarray. 
Israel<SEP>Contacts with EC In January 1989 Arafat held talks in Tunis with a UK Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, William Waldegrave, a meeting which the latter described as a major development in British foreign policy. During 1989 there were frequent EC denunciations of <ENT>Israel<ENT>'s handling of the intifada, and a communiquÃ© issued by EC leaders in Strasbourg in December 1989 condemned the economic restrictions and bureaucratic harassment imposed by Israel on Palestinian farmers and fruit growers in the occupied territories. In January 1990 members of the European Parliament called for an immediate suspension of all scientific co-operation projects between Israel and the EC, amidst plans for a doubling of direct EC aid to the occupied territories to US$12,000,000 a year by 1992 [ see also p. 37627 ]. 
United States<SEP>He maintained that Washington feared that the gradual shift of the states of the region into the political orbit of the Non-Aligned Movement could draw them away from the system of ` inter-American treaties of mutual assistance ". Soviet specialists believed that the shift towards non-alignment in Latin America was hastened by the political situation in the region after the Falklands War which resulted in ` an open crisis of the inter-American system, including its military-political mechanism ". At the conference of the Non-Aligned held in Managua in January 1983 the Cuban Foreign Minister, Malmierca, argued that the Falklands War ` proved to Latin Americans that their instruments and means of collective defence with the <ENT>United States<ENT>, which were supposedly for protection against extrahemispheric powers, are nothing but mechanisms to be used when Washington's interests are threatened by pro-independence actions in any of our states ". In place of the Organisation of American States and the Inter-American Treaty for Reciprocal Assistance he proposed that the Latin American and Caribbean states establish an agency of their own that would ` create mechanisms for [ mutual ] consultation and cooperation in the political field " and allow them ` to join our efforts in the defence of our common interest ". 
America<SEP>Or motorcycles? Or alcohol? Or have you forgotten that <ENT>America<ENT> did once try to ban alcohol, and look what happened! " Her voice was scathing. 
Israel<SEP>Shamir visit to USA On Dec. 11-14 the Israeli Prime Minister Itzhak Shamir visited the United States, at a critical juncture in Israeli-US relations [ see p. 37052 for Shamir's last visit to Washington in November 1989 ]. US President George Bush, concerned above all to hold together an anti-Iraq coalition in the Gulf which included key Arab allies, had quite openly distanced himself from <ENT>Israel<ENT> in recent months. In the event, however, Shamir's meeting with Bush in Washington on Dec. 12 was friendly and, according to the Financial Times of Dec. 12, " appeared to smooth over relations between the two leaders ". 
India<SEP>An Englishman's expectation of life at birth in the 1880s was 43.7 years, a Frenchman's a little over 40, and a German's a little under. By 1940 the first two might expect to live 60.2 and 55.9 years. These figures may be compared with those for <ENT>India<ENT>; in 1881 male life-expectancy at birth was 23.6 years there, and in 1931 this figure had risen to 26.9. It is worth recalling that on the eve of the French Revolution the French peasant's expectancy is thought to have been rather below that of the Indian in 1881; so far had Europe already come in the ninety years before 1880. 
Slovenia<SEP>Israel was reported on April 16 to have recognized Slovenia and Croatia, and on April 28 established diplomatic relations with Slovenia, while calling for Croatia to recognize its role in the Holocaust. On April 27 China recognized both republics. France established diplomatic relations with Slovenia on April 23, and with Croatia on April 24, confirming that it would support <ENT>Slovenia<ENT>'s request for UN membership and for co-operation with the EC. Croatian government reshuffle 
USA<SEP>Undoubtedly there have been numerous policy turnabouts, most noticeably at the time of the Cultural Revolution when forestry resources were misused for unsuitable land reclamation (Gustafsson, undated), which in certain particularly vulnerable areas may have exacerbated the destructive floods of autumn 1981. But the combination of the daunting task of national reconstruction after the Communist victory in 1949, the neglect of conservation for centuries, and a variety of purely physical factors making for great erosion hazards, must also be taken into account. Thus, as in the case of the <ENT>USA<ENT>, the size and complexity of the programmes, mixed successes, and the possibility that programmes have significantly reduced soil losses, or even the rate of decline rather than improved yields, point to the need for a longer and more sophisticated assessment than is given here. In Latin America, the state of soil erosion programmes is even worse (Preston 1980). 
Lebanon<SEP>Earlier yesterday, in the first visit by a US secretary of state to Beirut in ten years, he had 75 minutes of talks with Lebanon's president, Elias Hrawi, prime minister, Rafik al-Hariri, and foreign minister, Fares Bouez. Asked what he had achieved during such brief talks, Mr Christopher said: ` A commitment from the Lebanese government to resume negotiations as soon as possible. " Mr Bouez said <ENT>Lebanon<ENT> still wanted to see the implementation of a UN resolution demanding Israel immediately take back nearly 400 Palestinians deported to southern Lebanon. Mr Christopher plans to ask Israel to speed up a review of the case. 
Britain<SEP>Discussions on the Treaty of Rome had entered their final stages, with ratification outstanding only from France and West Germany. It was not surprising, therefore, that while the Six were willing to discuss the Grand Design within the OEEC context, they saw it as an addition to, not a replacement for, their own plans. <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s strategy was not just to block the Six, but to have something in place should they succeed in getting their common market off the ground. To counteract the possibility of discrimination by the EEC should it be able to establish a common external tariff, the other OEEC states would need to accept a lowering of or even an end to their tariffs, providing the Six would waive their common external tariff on goods coming from the rest of the OEEC. 
Australia<SEP>The brothers, JOHN McILWRAITH (1832-1902) and SIR THOMAS McILWRAITH (1835-1900), of Ayr, became Mayor of Melbourne and Prime Minister of Queensland, respectively; it was Sir Thomas who was responsible for Ayr in Queensland being so named. ANDREW FISHER (1862-1928) is the subject of a biographical sketch in Chapter 38; he rose through state politics in Queensland to serve terms as Prime Minister of Australia. From <ENT>Australia<ENT>, let us move on to New Zealand. On 27th November, 1847, the emigrant ships Phillip Lang and John Wickliffe sailed from Greenock with 247 Scottish men, women and children bound for a new way of life in New Zealand. 
Great Britain<SEP>British players are back to lift clubs By Cathy Harris THE availability of <ENT>Great Britain<ENT> players has boosted the medal hopes of Glasgow Western and Sutton Coldfield as they undertake their European campaigns in Holland this weekend. The British squad members may not be fully rested after their return yesterday from a 2Â½-week training trip to the United States, but their presence will serve as a psychological boost to their teams. 
Mexico<SEP>This kind of movement would cause panic and injuries in the top two floors. Bertero advocates stronger codes to govern the non structural elements, such as ceilings, windows and partitions, in tall buildings. The US should follow <ENT>Mexico<ENT> and New Zealand and set windows in rubber so they flex during an earthquake. The research also supports the need for a shear wall down the centre of buildings: it absorbed 85 per cent of the initial lateral force of the earthquake.

US<SEP>Israel's attendance, however, was " subject to a satisfactory solution to the issue of Palestinian Arab representation in the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation ". Baker described Shamir's announcement as " extraordinarily positive and significant ". Shamir had been under pressure to react positively to the <ENT>US<ENT> plan following Syria's approval of it in mid-July [ see p. 38358 ]. He was effectively obliged to do so when US President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev issued a statement on July 31 during their summit meeting in Moscow announcing a joint US-Soviet commitment toward convening the conference in October [ see p. 38320 ]. 
Belgium<SEP>The leading protagonists in Paris include Martin Margiela, Ann Demeulemeester, Veronique Leroy, Andre Walker, Helmut Lang, Jean Colonna, and Xuly Bet - all very different exponents of the new sensibility. But although this burst of new direction has logically exploded out of Paris, the world's fashion capital, the energy and creativity emerging from countries with traditionally low fashion profiles is what is truly intriguing and inspiring. <ENT>Belgium<ENT>, Holland, Norway and Sweden are producing some strong new designers of clothes, shoes and accessories. I occasionally lecture at the Hogeschool in Holland, where the talent is now exceptional, and a new mood is being defined out of a profound rejection of wearing your logo/status/money on your sleeve. 
Britain<SEP>When the plan fell through, he put them back into the larder till the next time. Case White, as the invasion was codenamed, was aborted by a signal issued at about 7.30 p.m. on August 25, because Mussolini and Ciano, when it came to it, summoned up the courage to tell Hitler the truth at last. Pact of Steel or not, they could not support him physically without large injections of armaments and raw materials: if he went into Poland, and France and <ENT>Britain<ENT> sprang to her defence, Italy would collapse. Forced by Mussolini's courage to be unusually clear-sighted in his turn, Joachim von Ribbentrop, the champagne salesman, advised his Fuhrer to call it off, an undertaking that would take about eight hours. 
US<SEP>Yeltsin did not hold talks with Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, who, according to Yeltsin, was " not feeling too well ". In the course of Yeltsin's visit the two sides signed 24 joint statements, documents and memorandums of understanding in areas including military and technical co-operation, space exploration, nuclear energy development, border security and armed forces reduction, trade and economic co-operation and educational and scientific exchanges. Lifting of German and <ENT>US<ENT> sanctions - Visit by US Cabinet member In early December the German Bundestag (lower house of the German parliament) voted to end formally the trade sanctions imposed against China after the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators [ see pp. 36720-22 ]. 
Croatia<SEP>A flurry of international diplomatic activity, principally involving the European Communities (EC), had achieved a fragile ceasefire by the end of the month. Federal attempts to halt secession On June 1, Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markovic condemned as illegal the moves by <ENT>Croatia<ENT> and Slovenia to secede. The leaders of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics met in Zagreb on June 6 and agreed to consider a compromise plan to transform the country into a loose alliance of sovereign states, based on a proposal put forward by the presidents of the republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia, Alija Izetbegovic and Kiro Gligorov. 
Iran<SEP>After all, the world is full of people in danger - look at Bosnia, many people there are in far greater immediate danger than I am. But the point is that this is about really gigantic things: freedom of speech, universality of human rights, even the issue of sovereignty. <ENT>Iran<ENT> has, after all, infringed British sovereignty by forcing it into massive protection for one of its own citizens. It's not that distant from an act of war; at the very least, it's extremely unfriendly. " 
USA<SEP>(1) The Origins of the War (1945-60) For over two decades, the <ENT>USA<ENT> sought to prevent the spread of communism in South-East Asia from the footholds it had acquired by the early 1950s in China and North Vietnam (CORE, pp. 156-7). The aim of successive American administrations had been to build up the strength of the most vulnerable states in the area - those known until the Second World War as French Indo-China and later divided into the separate states of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. 
France<SEP>On March 4 the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ratified the " two-plus-four " Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany and the German-Soviet Co-operation Treaty [ see pp. 37834-35 ]. Two treaties on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany and transitional measures for the withdrawal were approved in principle on the same date and ratified on April 2. The two-plus-four treaty had been ratified by Germany and the United States in October 1990 [ see p. 37762 ], by the United Kingdom in November [ see p. 37867 ] and by <ENT>France<ENT> on Dec. 13. German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher visited Moscow on March 17-18. 
Britain<SEP>His real desires, as I have said, were natural and healthy [hellip] Here at least was force, and something can be made of that. " There was no doubt a certain amount of wishful thinking in these common beliefs that gang fights represented some kind of scaled-down patriotism, but <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s military preoccupations were never too far out of sight when Hooliganism was on the agenda, involving reversals such as these on the Hooligan's worth and character. Baden-Powell, the man who galvanised the hopes and fears of Edwardian England into a truly spectacular social movement, was also given to some equally spectacular celebrations of Hooliganism. 
India<SEP>Later that day, All-India Radio quoted Narasimha Rao as saying that " there has not been much progress on the border issue with China ". On Tibet the communiquÃ© noted that China had " expressed concern about the continued activities in India by some Tibetans against their motherland ", while India had reaffirmed that " Tibet is an autonomous region of China ". In a gesture construed as a concession to China, the communiquÃ© also stated that <ENT>India<ENT> " does not allow Tibetans to engage in anti-China political activities in India ". On Dec. 11 the Indian government had ordered the arrest (overturned by the Supreme Court on Dec. 13) of more than 200 Tibetan demonstrators who clashed with police while protesting against Li's visit. 
United States<SEP>Pakistan ostensibly kept such ` strategic cooperation " secret to avoid the charge that it was violating the status of a non-aligned country. Such Soviet claims have been consistently rejected by Pakistani officials. In an address to the Pakistani National Assembly and Senate in December 1985 President Zia formally denied that his country had given any bases to the <ENT>United States<ENT>. Despite the controversy surrounding Soviet military action in Afghanistan, Soviet spokesmen in the mid 1980s still try to direct the principles of non-alignment against Western military links with Third World states. 
US<SEP>But they are often pretty mean about it. Lech Walesa was probably more popular when he was a freedom-fighter in Poland than when he came here recently and complained about the low level of enthusiasm for investing in his country.Today the only country to spend more than 1 per cent of its output on aid is Norway, with Holland and Denmark close behind. Britain shells out only 0.3 per cent, and the <ENT>US<ENT> 0.2 per cent. Events like Live Aid showed we are prepared to assist our fellow world citizens - even if there's a hefty dose of self-congratulation about how noble we are. 
Britain<SEP>[hellip] because the economic situation is now more serious than at any time over the last 25 years, the Government decided that resources must be released for investment and improving the balance of payments [hellip] The defence programme, with its considerable demands on skilled manpower and industry, should play its part in this process [hellip] The credibility of Defence in the Whitehall market-place was further weakened by three other factors: first, the ` bull " market enjoyed by the high-spending, socially-orientated departments - Health, Education, Labour and Social Services; secondly, the failure of our West European allies to match our level of Defence expenditure, thus providing arguments that <ENT>Britain<ENT> was doing more than her fair share in collective defence; and thirdly, trading rivals, like Germany and Japan, honing their competitive edge with lower military expenditure, likewise adding to the consensus view that Britain was overspending on Defence however potent the Soviet military threat might be. The ` bear " market in Defence shares is well illustrated in figure 1. 
Britain<SEP>These countries have won the biggest overseas slices of Calpers's $14 billion fund. But there the similarity ends. <ENT>Britain<ENT> has already moved towards putting independent directors on company boards, charging them with appointing auditors and overseeing bosses' pay. In Japan, talk of corporate governance has been about as common as sararimen in bowler hats. 
Latvia<SEP>Estonia established diplomatic relations with Cuba on Nov. 12, and with Mongolia on Nov. 20. The Danish Prime Minister, Poul SchlÃ¼ter, visited Estonia on Nov. 5-6, and signed a treaty of mutual investment and insurance opportunities with his Estonian counterpart, Edgar Savisaar. SchlÃ¼ter said that similar treaties with <ENT>Latvia<ENT> and Lithuania would be concluded in future. Conscription 
Denmark<SEP>The European companies were hoping to meet the deadline set by the International Radio Consultative Committee for the presentation of technical proposals for a new system which, once chosen, would effectively set a world standard, Japan and the USA having already submitted their applications to the Committee. Foreign Ministers had approved in Luxembourg on Oct. 5, by a majority verdict, a directive setting minimum ethical standards for television broadcasting in the single market. <ENT>Denmark<ENT> and Belgium voted against the measure, which was adopted despite fears about mandatory maximum quotas for non-EC material (see p. 37211-12 for Council of Europe convention on this issue). The USA had threatened on Oct. 11 to take the EC to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) over the issue, which it claimed was protectionist. 
Jordan<SEP>The Village Leagues posed a serious threat since they affected many West Bank villages. Jordan warned Village League followers that they risked the charge of treason. The PLO supported <ENT>Jordan<ENT> against the Village Leagues, since its own legitimacy was directly challenged by them. Jordan and the PLO defeated the Leagues, and in the process made the villages more politically aware. 
Venezuela<SEP>Other joint agreements included the assignment of individual leaders of member countries to supervise and take responsibility for " implementing action " in six key areas identified by an independent West Indian commission. These were (i) intra-regional travel; (ii) the free movement of skilled and professional people; (iii) the creation of a Caribbean Investment Fund within 12 months with an initial capitalization of approximately US$50,000,000; (iv) the creation of a common currency; (v) the creation of a single common market (see above); and (vi) " mobilization for international negotiations ". <ENT>Venezuela<ENT> also signed an agreement to begin discussions by mid-September on conditions for the future access of CARICOM products to the Venezuelan market. 
Monaco<SEP>Ben Bacon MARK HATELEY breathed life into Rangers' European Cup challenge last night, just as their hopes seemed to have been killed off by Marseille's foreign legion. Hateley, whose football education included three seasons in France with <ENT>Monaco<ENT>, capped one of the bravest and most unlikely comebacks when he scored with seven minutes remaining to level the scores of this epic Group A encounter at two goals each. However, even a solitary point looked a far-fetched dream for the Scottish champions until 22-year-old substitute Gary McSwegan grabbed his first goal for the club in the 79th minute. 
USSR<SEP>Whereas 54 per cent had professed faith in Soviet postwar co-operativeness in answer to an opinion poll in the middle of 1945, by February 1946 this figure had been almost halved. More and more members of the American foreign service were coming to question the belief, strongly held at the end of the war, that the USSR was more likely to be caught up in rivalry with the British than with the United States. Byrnes began to retreat from his unilateral dealings with the <ENT>USSR<ENT>, especially when the limited agreements he had concluded in Moscow in December 1945 were sharply criticized back home as a return to appeasement. Truman commented that it was time to stop " babying the Soviets ". 
Austria<SEP>Even if the Russians could be dislodged from the north side of Sevastopol ", the allies would soon reach the point where their ships were unable to help them. They would also have to undertake exceptional recruitment measures at home. The assistance which they continued to seek from <ENT>Austria<ENT> might not tip the scales in their favour. Indeed, Austrian entry into the war might provoke a crisis in the Habsburg Empire greater than that of 1848-9 and throw the whole of central Europe into the melting-pot. 
Finland<SEP>Sales and unit growth of the small scale multi-user systems market is forecast at 6% over the period, with average cost falling from $38,000 to $36,400 in 1997. Value of medium scale multi-user systems will reach 10% CAGR - 7% in units - with average cost rising from $216,300 to $268,000. Unix growth in Germany and Spain will remain above average throughout the period, with Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and <ENT>Finland<ENT> below the mark. 
Nigeria<SEP>NIGERIA: CRADLE OF ENTREPRENEURS? A series of studies of such businessmen have been conducted by Nigerian scholars, and these are particularly significant given the fact that <ENT>Nigeria<ENT> accounts for one third of ` value added " in manufacturing in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole (excluding South Africa). Elsewhere, Africa's leading industrialists tend to be the chairmen or directors of companies which are owned or managed by multinational companies. 
Ireland<SEP>Underwood's recent retirement from the international scene as England's most capped player highlights the distinguished contribution made to English rugby, both on and off the field, by the RAF. It is particularly fitting that Underwood should have chosen to step down in a year when the president of the Rugby Football Union is Peter Yarranton, himself a former England player and RAF pilot, who will be at today's game. Underwood's position as England's leading try-scorer, with 35 to his credit, has a two-fold RAF connection because when he scored against <ENT>Ireland<ENT> in 1990 the record he overtook had previously been held by another RAF pilot and winger, Cyril Lowe, who totalled 18 between 1913 and 1923 when winning 25 consecutive caps. The RAF can thus boast that it has held England's try-scoring record since 1921, the year Lowe broke the previous best. 
Germany<SEP>Holy Smoke Burnt Roof (published by the Author, 107pp, illus, hbk, Â£11.70 inc p&p) by The Reverend A A Upton is the story of St Laurence's Church, Foleshill, which was the first church in Coventry to be closed as a result of <ENT>Germany<ENT>'s Blitz on Britain during 1940. The recorded history of the church goes back to the mid-12th century, and in this study the Author describes church life in Foleshill from the outbreak of World War Two, right through to the restoration of the Old Church (as it is known locally). 
El Salvador<SEP>Support needed Des Smith (` Forgotten innocents ", 20 March) rightly points out that the conditions of the Guatemalan refugees have been largely ignored by the world's media. While Nicaragua and <ENT>El Salvador<ENT> were perceived during the 1980s by the US State Department to be on the frontline of the fight against communism (and therefore newsworthy), the larger-scale massacres in neighbouring Guatemala received no attention: journalists wandering around the scorched highlands simply couldn't get their stories printed. Unless we are more attentive, the Guatemalan refugees are about to be ignored again as they suffer this time not from the cold war, but the ` new world order ". 
Great Britain<SEP>One disappointing absentee is Jonathan Davies, who has been playing with such verve at full-back recently but has not recovered from his damaged hamstring, allowing Alan Tait to revert to full-back. Shaun Wane and Adrian Shelford come into a Wigan side now without their Australians, Les Davidson and Phil Blake. For Bradford's visit, Leeds - whose squad has been strengthened by the arrival from Barrow of the Australian forward Cavill Heugh - have dropped the <ENT>Great Britain<ENT> prop Lee Crooks. In dispute with the club earlier in the season, Crooks is having weight and fitness problems. 
France<SEP>She would be opposed to a wholesale withdrawal from West Germany. Britain will have to decide with its wartime allies whether Berlin's status as an enclave under notional military government needs to be reviewed. Some experts believe that Germany would be required to sign a treaty with Britain, <ENT>France<ENT> and the Soviet Union before they withdraw from Berlin. 
Ireland<SEP>The South-West - whose Bath-Bristol-Gloucester resources have appeared in the past to resemble rugby's equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle - are set on improving their disappointing Divisional Championship record, and their success against Leinster in Dublin last week was seen as a first step in the right direction. While Halliday takes on a new role, David Irwin is just happy to return to the scene. Irwin, the centre whose back injury ruled him out of <ENT>Ireland<ENT>'s tour of North America, plays his first game for four months when Instonians take on Malone this weekend. Irwin has also been selected as captain to face Connacht in Galway on Saturday week by Ulster, who tackle the All Blacks in Belfast on 21 November, three days after the Dublin international. 
United States<SEP>For the first time, the United Nations would be able to operate effectively as the guarantor of a law-bound international order, with the United States acting as its enforcement arm against aggressors. A new world order, indeed. A less hopeful view is that the <ENT>United States<ENT> will now be able to use force, if necessary, to apply its national interests throughout the world without fear of challenge, and to tow the United Nations obediently behind it. Backyards, incidentally, remain backyards. 
United States<SEP>This says that a member can defend itself, but in no sense does it endorse a prolonged campaign of counter-attack. Since the Gulf war, the United States and Britain have used the United Nations to bleed Iraq; and the sufferers have been primarily children, whose death-rate has increased by an estimated 400 per cent. Now the <ENT>United States<ENT> is on the verge of bombing Iraq on the pretext that Iraq refuses to destroy its ` weapons of mass destruction " - when, in fact, Iraq has asked that some of its military industry be converted to civilian production laid waste by allied bombing. The bombing would probably finish off Iraq's industrial base. 
Bulgaria<SEP>In this way all 1,400 students would have the opportunity to travel once during their two-year course. Mr Peter Shuker, the principal, said the college now had links with France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. There are plans for tie-ups with <ENT>Bulgaria<ENT> and Romania in the near future. He said the college had already secured Â£20,000 worth of grants from European Community funds with a further Â£20,000 in the pipeline. 
India<SEP>In total 2,600 British companies have profited. India's own highly capable power industry is suffering from slim order books when all around foreign companies, backed by aid, are erecting smokestacks. ` The British have not bought a nail from <ENT>India<ENT>, " said a former Indian civil servant. ` Even stone chips - simple pebbles - for the water-treatment plant have been imported. " 
United Kingdom<SEP>(4) The matters adverted to in question (4) do not affect the answers given to questions (2) and (3). 82. It follows from those answers that the Commission's action against the United Kingdom for failure to fulfil its obligations is well founded and hence the court should declare in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89) that, by imposing the nationality requirements enshrined in sections 13 and 14 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> has failed to fulfil its obligations under articles 52 and 221 of the E.E.C. Treaty. 83. 
New Zealand<SEP>If the Lions trip here is to be worthwhile in terms of Test results and tour morale it is essential that this one is a victory. New Zealand have not played together as a unit since last August in South Africa, where they narrowly beat the Springboks. ` Ten months is a long time to be apart and then to be brought together to compete against such a good, experienced team as the Lions, " said Grant Fox, <ENT>New Zealand<ENT>'s masterly goal kicker. Fox's kicking is crucial to the All Black's game but there are inevitably, other great and experienced winners around him. 
Greece<SEP>Nearly a million people (a tenth of Greece's population) demonstrated in Salonika; an opinion poll said that 72% were against any compromise on the name, and 20% were ready to fight about it; and up to a quarter of New Democracy's members of parliament threatened rebellion. The Macedonia eruption is now technically over. <ENT>Greece<ENT> was obliged this spring to accept the new country's admission to the United Nations with ` Macedonia " in its name, and the New Democracy rebels swallowed their fury when they realised that voting against the government would cause an election their party would probably lose. But the damage is done. 
Austria<SEP>A working group established at the Berlin conference has elaborated a series of proposals for the Budapest conference to adopt, said Loeschnak. These include a unified system of penalties for smuggling people, the creation special units to deal with illegal migration, the exchange of information and unified border controls. <ENT>Austria<ENT> is expected to propose at the conference the setting up of a European Migration Charter, a document which will have to be elaborated on later. 
Australia<SEP>At the beginning of January 1990 he announced a 10 per cent devaluation of the kina with an exhortation for the nation to stop living beyond its means. The devaluation came in the wake of a package of measures by the Bank of Papua New Guinea (central bank) designed to apply strict fiscal discipline to the economy. In May <ENT>Australia<ENT> acceded to urgent representations from the PNG government and announced an increase of A$20,000,000 (approximately US$15,270,000) in aid. The World Bank and the other major donors including the European Communities indicated significant increases at the same time. 
Syria<SEP>Clinton, meanwhile, was regarded as pro-Israeli and his victory was greeted with some alarm by the Arab countries, which feared a return to a policy of unconditional US support for Israel. According to some commentators the peace process would effectively be placed on hold at least until January 1993 when Clinton took office. Negotiations between Israel and <ENT>Syria<ENT>, about which there had been some optimism during the sixth and the first part of the seventh round, were largely unproductive. Syria continued to demand a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights which Israel flatly rejected. 
Rwanda<SEP>The ways by which this class comes about and the implications and feedback effects to and from the natural environment are discussed in Chapters 6, 7 and 8. Three brief case studies illustrate the related issues of population growth (without significant outmigration), stagnant production, poverty of most of the people of the area concerned, and environmental decline. The first, is Rwanda where ` given conditions of rapid population growth and limited natural resources, <ENT>Rwanda<ENT> faces a number of serious environmental problems " (USAID; 1981 p.V). Deforestation, overgrazing and shortened fallow periods threaten the fragility of Rwanda's soils. 
Denmark<SEP>The most strenuous victory of the day was claimed by the Spaniard, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario who survived several nerve-racking moments before beating Brenda Schultz, of the Netherlands, 2-6, 6-4, 10-8. Sanchez's victory earned Spain, the second seeds, a quarter-final confrontation with the Soviet Union. At the top end of the draw, the United States swept to a 3-0 win over <ENT>Denmark<ENT> and will next face Austria. The most intriguing quarter-final will pit Czechoslovakia against Steffi Graf's West Germany. 
Fiji<SEP>FIJI General election - Appointment of Rabuka as Prime Minister On May 23-30 <ENT>Fiji<ENT> held its first general election since the two military coups of 1987 [ see pp. 35251-55; 35567-70 ]. In July 1990 a new Constitution had institutionalized the dominance of ethnic Fijians in a 70-member House of Representatives and an appointed Senate [ see p. 37614 ]. 
Britain<SEP>The President of the Baptist Union called on the United States' ambassador but unfortunately he was out. He had better luck when sending a cablegram to the American President who replied, ` The President deeply appreciates the friendly sentiment expressed by you on behalf of the influential body which you represent. " The following year the Baptists rejoiced in the American victory and recorded the ` confident hope that henceforth America and <ENT>Britain<ENT> will alike and together, in every part of the world, be the friends of the oppressed and down-trodden, the champions of civil and religious freedom, and the promoters of righteousness and peace. " Congregationalists at the 1899 May meetings gave a rapturous ovation to the American deputation to show their support for America's ` high-minded purpose ". 
United States<SEP>A communiquÃ© issued at the end of the conference condemned the " US-led military campaign against Iraq [ as ] an act of aggression against the Arab nation ". The communiquÃ© also supported " the political initiative declared by the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein which linked the Gulf crisis to the Middle East conflict ". At a news conference on Sept. 18 Habash declared that " in case the <ENT>United States<ENT> and its allies commit an aggression against Iraq, our fingers will pull the trigger to open fire on the forces of aggression ". He added that " the Gulf crisis must be resolved within an Arab framwork " and announced that the PFLP would shortly be opening an office in Baghdad, although there were no plans to do so in Jordan. 
USA<SEP>An estimated 200,000 troops were confined to special bases under the terms of the May peace agreement between the government and UNITA [ see p. 38180 ]. All 50 assembly points were reportedly experiencing acute food shortages. Concerned about the possibility of food riots which would disrupt the peace process, the USA sent 450,000 ready-made meals from its Defence Department stocks in Europe and the Gulf; officials said that the <ENT>USA<ENT> planned to provide one-third of the nutritional needs of the troops for a year. The UN World Food Programme undertook to provide food, tents and domestic utensils, worth US$27,300,000, for six months. 
Portugal<SEP>Redknapp rallies young England AN INSPIRATIONAL performance from Liverpool's Jamie Redknapp helped England's Under-21 side make a superb start to the Toulon tournament with a 2-0 win over holders <ENT>Portugal<ENT>. Lawrie McMenemy's men went ahead when a free-kick by Tottenham striker Darren Anderton was headed into his own net by defender Nuno Luis. 
United States<SEP>By early 1973 it was clear that they would do little or nothing to protect the exchange rate from the impact of domestic policies, and indeed increasingly resented the attempts of European and Japanese central banks to prevent the dollar rate from finding its own level. Such a position would be quite incomprehensible if the main thrust of US policy was an attempt to run as large as possible a balance of payments deficit (on current and long-term capital account) in order to grab real resources from the rest of the world in exchange for paper dollars. On the contrary, given the heavy and increasing rate of capital exports, which was a major priority for many of the dominating US multinationals, it was far better from the <ENT>United States<ENT>' point of view that these capital exports should be mainly financed by a current account surplus rather than by endless piling up of US liabilities abroad to foreign central banks. The return paid on these liabilities was certainly low (the short-term interest rate in real terms averaged 0.4 per cent over the years 1968-74). 
Australia<SEP>If only Clive Rice had not been dropped by South Africa, maybe I could have persuaded the England selectors to give me a chance [hellip] IT HAPPENS in one-day cricket too. In the finals of the 1990-91 World Series Cup, <ENT>Australia<ENT> fielded twin Waughs and two unrelated Taylors, while both Australia and New Zealand had a Jones and a Reid. - ED. 
East Germany<SEP>Senior East German Social Democrats believe that even the slower process under Article 146 could be completed this year. They are aware of the danger of putting themselves in the same opposition boat as the Party of Democratic Socialism, formerly the communist party, which has its doubts about unity. Besides, with GEMU, which no East German politician dare oppose, <ENT>East Germany<ENT> will already have yielded its monetary sovereignty to the West German Bundesbank and with it a lot of its room for political manoeuvre. Foot-dragging over political union will then seem pretty pointless. 
UK<SEP>We shall return to this issue at several points later in this volume. The geographical destinations of exports have shown a swing towards the EC. As recently as 1970 the Commonwealth accounted for 20 per cent of the value of the <ENT>UK<ENT>'s trade in manufactured goods, but by 1982 that share had decreased to 11 per cent. Table 2.2 demonstrates changes over the seventeen years to 1987: western Europe took over half our exports for the first time in recent history; by 1987, the EC alone took virtually half, and most other destinations, except for North America, had declined in relative importance. 
Hong Kong<SEP>UK minister's visit to China - British Nationality Act Visit by Francis Maude to China - Talks with Li Peng In his last assignment as Minister of State at the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Francis Maude visited China on July 25-27, primarily for talks on <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT>. (Maude had officially been promoted to a senior Treasury post prior to his visit.) 
Iraq<SEP>It has since emerged that several aircrew were reluctant to continue the slaughter. General Schwarzkopf, summing up the overall result on 27 February, described the rout of the Iraqi army as having been achieved by a ` flanking manoeuvre, trapping thousands of its troops ". The Allied air forces were meanwhile continuing their hunt for the sites from which <ENT>Iraq<ENT> was firing its Scud missiles at Saudi Arabia and Israel. The main problem was that the missile launchers were often mobile, moving from site to site. 
Indonesia<SEP>THE All England Club chairman, R E H ` Buzzer " Hadingham, 73, is to step down in December after six years in charge of Wimbledon. JOHN McENROE and Michael Chang head the entries for the grand prix tournament at Wembley on 7-12 November. Revised first-round draw: Italy v New Zealand; Soviet Union v Switzerland; Canada v Brazil; Spain v France; United States v Greece; Czechoslovakia v Belgium; Sweden v Japan; West Germany v Finland; Australia v China; Argentina v Philippines; Bulgaria v South Korea; Netherlands v Yugoslavia; Denmark v Poland; Britain v <ENT>Indonesia<ENT>; Austria v Mexico; Hungary v Thailand. 
Britain<SEP>Britain suffered a a double setback at last week's meeting of the London Dumping Convention. On Thursday delegates approved a resolution calling for a two-year ban on dumping radioactive wastes in the sea. And the following day <ENT>Britain<ENT> lost its battle to impose the burden of scientific proof on those who oppose radioactive dumping. The two-year moratorium is not binding, and Britain, which is responsible for 90 per cent of all radioactive waste dumped at sea, has already said that it will not comply with the ban. 
Fiji<SEP>Following their success in a Dubai tournament in November, the Scots have been seeded first for an event in Canberra on March 13 which opens their tour. The Australians have had to be content with the second favourites slot in front of their home crowd. Third seeds are Western Samoa, whose preparations for Murrayfield include a special training camp in Auckland, and if the draw goes according to plan Scotland will face fourth-seeded <ENT>Fiji<ENT> in the semis. The Canberra draw pairs Scotland with Canada and an Australian Capital Territories team in the preliminary pool. 
Britain<SEP>The shades of the nineteenth century seem to loom larger than the prospects of the 21st Century which is what we should be aiming for. The world has always looked to Britain for stability, inventiveness and general mental agility, yet our National Prestige is low, our currency is less than one third of its immediate post-war value against the dollar and can not be explained entirely as a result of market speculation. The world has lost confidence in us and now doubts <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s ability to successfully deal with its economic problems - this at a time when we are major producers of oil! There has been much discussion recently about the value of the pound compared to the dollar. 
South Africa<SEP>The question is whether he is the right man for the sensitive media liaison portfolio. A paper suggested that, in keeping with the selection of the management team, Mickey Mouse should be adopted as the official mascot. Nice men all but surely not the management for <ENT>South Africa<ENT>'s first major tour since 1981. Another body blow to South African morale was the decision by Jannie Breedt not to make himself available for the tour. 
Italy<SEP>Women's doubles semi-finals: G Fernandez, M J Fernandez (US) bt L Meskhi, N Zvereva (CIS) 6-4, 7-5; A Sanchez-Vicario, C Martinez (Spn) bt R McQuillan, N Provis (Aus) 6-1, 6-2. WATER POLO Group A: Australia 15, Czechoslovakia 9; United States 7, Germany 2; CIS 9, France 5. Group B: Hungary 13, Holland 13; <ENT>Italy<ENT> 8, Greece 6; Spain 12, Cuba 10. WRESTLING Heavyweight final: B Baumgartner (US) bt J Thue (Can). 
United States<SEP>Will the Secretary of State keep in this country what James Watson, the discoverer of the DNA basis of the genetic code, has described as the jewel in the crown of British science? Will he authorise the Medical Research Council to plan on the basis that the funding needed by Dr. John Sulston of the laboratory of molecular biology of Cambridge will be available to keep in this country work on the nematode project, as that work is the foundation of the human genome project which is the foundation of the future of medical research and biotechnology? Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman aware that the <ENT>United States<ENT> has made a bid for that work? If funding is not available, and it can not be found within the present budget, the Secretary of State will be guilty of the loss of that work? 
Thailand<SEP>In a message officially acknowledging Thailand's decision to comply with Article VIII the Managing Director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, said that it was a " clear indication of the country's economic strength and its willingness to support a liberalized foreign exchange system ". Thailand became the 68th country out of the 152 IMF members to comply with Article VIII. On the same day Pramual announced that <ENT>Thailand<ENT> would repay by May 31 all existing loans owed to the IMF in the form of special drawing rights (SDRs) worth SDR53,900,000 (equivalent to approximately $71,580,000). The repayment was made 3@1/2 years before the original deadline. 
Libya<SEP>Even by the brazen standards established in the Iraq affair, the United States' and hence the UN Security Council's breaches of international treaties and laws are astonishing. As an Egyptian columnist recently remarked in the Cairo newspaper Al Ahram: ` What this shows is that the new world order is a system of codified international piracy. " <ENT>Libya<ENT> is acting in accord with international laws and treaties. Having instituted proceedings against its two citizens, it is under no obligation to extradite them to either the US or UK. 
UK<SEP>Stores, breweries, leisure stocks, banks and insurance shares were in the vanguard of the rises and at the close of the trading session a bumper Â£6bn had flowed in. The strong upward movement was triggered by a bullish forecast from the CBI - the bosses' union - that the economy will start to emerge gradually from the recession in the Spring of next year. Underlying inflation, now around the 3.7% mark, is expected to slow but due to the devaluation of the pound <ENT>UK<ENT> exports should pick up dramatically because the price of British goods will be much cheaper abroad. The recent cuts in the mortgage rate - with the cost of borrowing on homes now down to around the 7-8% level - will also fuel a wave of spending in the high street. 
France<SEP>Enter the new championship, with a complicated set of rules designed to promote an outright winner at the end of it. As far as the game in Paris was concerned, the only lingering doubts before kick-off concerned the margin of the French victory. As the Welsh had been written off even by their most loyal supporters, the French media was at pains to try to explain to their bemused readership the concept of points differential, in other words point out that in order to win the cup <ENT>France<ENT> had to score at least as many points as England had in Dublin. With England being sorely demolished, the decision to take the trophy to Paris, strongly criticised by some sections of the English media, was fully vindicated. 
South Africa<SEP>The United Cricket Board of South Africa has announced the itinerary for India's tour of the Republic later this year: There will also be seven One-Day Internationals between December 7 and 19. To commemorate <ENT>South Africa<ENT>'s readmission to Test cricket, Coopers and Lybrand Ratings have published a list of what their world rankings would have been in March 1970 when South Africa played their last Test match. Graeme Pollock led the batting ratings (896pts), followed by Doug Walters, John Edrich, Gary Sobers and Bill Lawry, while Derek Underwood was rated as the world's top bowler ahead of Mike Proctor, Peter Pollock, Perver Sajjad and Bishen Bedi. 
New York/New Jersey<SEP>Then Humphries returned to New York and the rest is making our Swiss friends very happy. ` The thing about the record is the influences of the music. The bottom end is very <ENT>New York/New Jersey<ENT> and the top is very melodic, very European. It's a hybrid. 
US<SEP>Mr Guillermo ` Billy " Ford, a vice-presidential Adoc candidate, was also severely bloodied and beaten even as the other Adoc leader, Mr Ricardo Arias Calderon, condemned the cancellation of the poll as ` an unbearable mockery of the will of the Panamanian people ". The fraudulent conduct of the poll, and the subsequent annullment, was deplored by the former President, Mr Jimmy Carter. But the <ENT>US<ENT> appeared powerless to intervene as Gen Noriega persisted in the harassment and arrest of his opponents and the continued muzzling of the media. Mr Ford and Mr Arias Calderon subsequently left Panama and last summer, Mr Ford visited Mrs Thatcher at Downing Street. 
America<SEP>The American public crowed when the junk-bond market collapsed. But junk bonds helped many successful businesses, which now face hard times EVERYBODY is dancing on the grave of Drexel Burnham Lambert - everybody but entrepreneurial <ENT>America<ENT>, that is. The hundreds of businesses that have grown with the help of the $200 billion-plus market for high-risk, high-yield securities created by Drexel do not share the American public's jubilation over the investment bank's demise, which came after paying a $650m fine on six counts of mail and securities fraud. 
USA<SEP>EUROPEAN ELECTRONICS CHAMPIONS VERSUS <ENT>USA<ENT> AND JAPAN Let us briefly note the dilemmas facing the electronics champions of Germany, France, Britain and The Netherlands. 
Britain<SEP>But whatever the president's motives, he added to Britain's problems in Palestine. In desperation the British gave up the Palestinian mandate in May 1948, while trying to rescue what they could of their relationship with the Arabs. Thus in the winter of 1948-49 - as fighting resumed between Israel and the Arabs - <ENT>Britain<ENT> seemed close to intervention on behalf of Egypt. On this occasion London even seemed prepared to risk a collision with Washington. 
Turkey<SEP>Shrewsbury-born Atkinson revealed his passing ability by picking out Dean Saunders with a ball threaded 25 yards through the United defence. His speed of thought presented as much of a threat to United as his speed off the mark. And he has out-scored Les Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers, who is in Taylor's squad for the World Cup qualifier with <ENT>Turkey<ENT>. ` Dalian took his goal brilliantly, " said Villa chief Ron Atkinson, who bought the England ` B " man for Sheffield Wednesday as well as his current club. 
Rwanda<SEP>AFRICA BURUNDI Security talks with ZaÃ¯re and <ENT>Rwanda<ENT> The Presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and ZaÃ¯re met on Jan. 4 in Mbandaka, north-western ZaÃ¯re, to discuss the problems of border controls and refugees, following the December flight of Hutu refugees from Burundi into Rwanda and ZaÃ¯re. 
Australia<SEP>But, as DAVID SOLE, the Scottish captain, tells BILL McMURTRIE, it wasn't all bad [hellip] Sentiment was deliberately left out of the equation when David Sole played his last game of rugby. The principal was Scotland's Second Test against <ENT>Australia<ENT> at Ballymore in June, and Sole even scored a try in his finale. It was not, however, a storybook finish to an illustrious career. 
Kampuchea<SEP>In pursuing their brand of communism, the Khmers Rouges were responsible for the deaths of perhaps Im people, a seventh of the population. The prospect of their return to power may, however, be more alarmist than real. Reports from <ENT>Kampuchea<ENT> claim that the country's 35,000-man army is good enough to stand up to Khmer Rouge incursions. There are also probably around 400,000 Vietnamese civilians settled in Kampuchea, many of whom can double as fighters. 
Singapore<SEP>By MARTIN BAKER ` YOU don't need to outperform the market to make spectacular returns in South-east Asia, " says Jonathan Custance Baker, of James Capel Unit Trust Management, introducing yet another entrant to the index fund market. Just over 18 per cent of the Tiger Index Fund will follow each of the DTI approved markets such as Hong Kong, <ENT>Singapore<ENT> and Malaysia and half this percentage will go into others. 
Hong Kong<SEP>Eagles v <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT> THE EAGLES' 1992 international schedule will kick off on April 18 with a Test against a visiting Hong Kong side in the newly-renovated Kezar Stadium in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. 
China<SEP>By giving more or less free rein to the more extreme parts of the opposition, he encourages talk of Taiwan's independence. Eleven members of the Democratic Progressive party elected to the National Assembly have been barred from taking their seats because they will not take an oath of loyalty to the Republic of China (the official name for Taiwan), only to the Republic of Taiwan. Independence may be a reality in fact if not in name, but it contradicts the dream of a united China that both the Kuomintang and the communists of Beijing hold dear - so dear that <ENT>China<ENT> has always threatened to use force if Taiwan declared independence. Somehow Mr Lee has to carry the old guard with him, not least because the mainlanders dominate the legislature as well as the National Assembly. 
Britain<SEP>One German paper commented frankly: ` Kohl wants to force political union with the Deutsche Mark crowbar ". The tactic used by the Commission for passing the Single European Act was to present it to the member states as if it were the only thing on offer: either take this or leave the Community. In particular, ` <ENT>Britain<ENT> was bounced into surrenders of sovereignty which she would never have accepted if they had been presented as abstract ideas ". The same ambiguous approach is being employed to achieve EMU. 
Japan<SEP>There are now 200 brands of breakfast cereal in America; 220 types of cigarettes in Holland and 100 perfumes in Argentina. This trademarked torrent, and the advertising avalanche that comes with it, has only bolstered the belief that brands are all the same. Perceptions of product parity are highest in markets like <ENT>Japan<ENT>, where product proliferation is wildest. Product proliferation also begat the promotion monster. 
Hungary<SEP>European Community <ENT>Hungary<ENT> granted Â£800m loan deal. By Reuter in Brussels 
America<SEP>How North Korea will react is anybody's guess. The meeting itself takes care of one North Korean demand. It wanted talks with <ENT>America<ENT>, not just with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or the United Nations. Parallel talks will open shortly between North and South Korea. 
People's Republic of China<SEP>Such disincentives should be applied if Israel's position does not change. To allow it to maintain the 300 nuclear weapons that it is currently estimated to hold - including 100 tactical weapons - can only provoke and encourage the Arab states' determination to obtain nuclear arsenals. For many years the <ENT>People's Republic of China<ENT> has been one of the world's leading conventional arms and nuclear technology exporters. It has proliferated nuclear weapon technologies and heavy weaponry to Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and now to Iran. 
Britain<SEP><ENT>Britain<ENT> must come first IN his Autumn Statement tomorrow the Chancellor is expected to give the go-ahead to several multi-million pound projects that would provide British industry with the boost it needs. 
Hong Kong<SEP>Stocks soar as China approves <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT> deals HONG Kong stocks hit record highs today after China endorsed three business contracts valid past the colony's 1997 return to China, allowing a long-delayed cable television project to go ahead. 
Iraq<SEP>Atlantik-BrÃ¼cke, an outfit that fosters German-American ties, has launched a campaign to help families in Germany of allied servicemen sent to the Gulf. But these things stand out because they go against the trend on the streets - and in parliament. While allied airmen risk their lives in the Arabian desert, politicians in Bonn squabble over whether Germany is bound by treaty to aid Turkey, a NATO partner, should it be attacked by <ENT>Iraq<ENT>. The opposition Social Democrats even urge the recall of the 18 elderly Alpha jets already sent by Germany to Turkey, and demand a Gulf ceasefire. 
France<SEP>Observers noted that many conservatives opposed to the political and economic reforms of Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche had failed to be reselected. Loan agreements with Italy With the signing of two financial agreements with Algeria on May 2, Italy was confirmed as one of Algeria's main commercial partners - a policy said to provide endorsement for Hamrouche's reform programme and to contrast with the more cautious attitude of <ENT>France<ENT>, Algeria's most important trading partner. According to the agreements, the Central Bank of Algeria would receive credits of US$2,500 million to help restructure debt repayments falling due in the period until January 1993. 
Iran<SEP>There was still no news of Waite, but I read that Archbishop Runcie's offer to help Iran locate four of its diplomats still missing in Beirut had received official welcome. In return Iran was going to help Runcie find Waite. More and more, ever since Irangate, <ENT>Iran<ENT> seemed to have a crucial role to play in the release of American and French hostages. Not that that was much help; it still looked more likely that John was with a group backed by Syria and Libya. 
Pakistan<SEP>King Asif ASIF MUJTABA scored 125, his second unbeaten century of the match, to steer <ENT>Pakistan<ENT> to 291-5 and a five-wicket win over Queensland in Brisbane. 
Britain<SEP>British cinema increasingly became a bargain-basement imitation of Hollywood. Instead of five large companies dominating production, distribution and exhibition, as in the US, it had two, Rank and ABPC. Producers were so busy fighting their own corner, and so mesmerized by the success of Hollywood, that they didn't have the strength to argue that keeping the industry fragmented and flexible, learning from Hollywood's example without simply imitating its outward forms, might be a better way of catering for a market the size of <ENT>Britain<ENT> than heading up the road of monopoly. Even today, when the tottering of a Goldcrest or TESE is taken as a sign that the film industry is going under, it's assumed that big companies are the key to surviving in the film business, because that's the way they do things in LA. 
Bosnia<SEP>President Izetbegovic, a Muslim who represents the largest ethnic group, has appealed for UN help to stave off civil war. He blamed Serbian militants for the rapidly deteriorating situation, saying they were trying to thwart international recognition of Bosnia. EC foreign ministers are expected to rule on <ENT>Bosnia<ENT>'s request for diplomatic recognition in Brussels today. They are also due to take up a similar request by Macedonia and discuss whether Serbia and Montenegro alone can inherit Yugoslavia's international status. 
South Africa<SEP>Very bad erm and they were saying that er, <ENT>South Africa<ENT>'s going to have to import food this year That's right, yeah 
America<SEP>A world apart <ENT>America<ENT> is riding high on a wave of post-Gulf confidence, but one part of the country is still missing out: the poverty-ridden ghettos where millions of black Americans live. George Bush can not afford to ignore them 
U.S.A.<SEP>I began my modest research post on 1st January, 1962. At that time,, who had been a graduate of, and teacher in, my department at U.C.L., had accepted a chair at U.C.L., and was about to return to his old department once again, having spent a number of years at the University of Durham. He suggested to our supervisor that we should read the ` new linguistics " coming out of the <ENT>U.S.A.<ENT>, in order to arrive at the best analytic categories and techniques for analysing the language of television. ` New linguistics ", for us, included books on English by,, and; but at that time we had not caught up with the new developments associated with. 
Belgium<SEP>The Train brothers were running 4th in C2 but 200m from the end they turned on the power and comfortably passed Cain/Chubaty of Canada. The afternoon of repÃªchages had no British involvement, a unique situation. The K4 heats produced some very close pairs, Finland and China, Austria and France and Portugal and <ENT>Belgium<ENT>. The semi finals followed on the Friday. 
Indonesia<SEP>President Suharto of Indonesia, accompanied by his Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, Economy and Finance Minister Radius Prawiro and State Secretary Moerdiono, made an official visit to Vietnam on Nov. 19-21. Suharto held talks with Nguyen Van Linh, secretary-general of the Communist Party of Vietnam, with Vo Chi Cong, President of the State Council and effectively head of state, and with Do Muoi, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, which focused on prospects for co-operation between the two countries, and on Cambodia, which was also discussed in a meeting between Alatas and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Co Thach. In talks with Tran Duc Luong, a Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Prawiro said that <ENT>Indonesia<ENT> would support Vietnam's application for aid from international financial institutions. An agreement was signed on economic, scientific and technological co-operation, and a financial joint venture, Indovina, was established - Vietnam's first such joint venture with a foreign country. 
Vietnam<SEP>That has been the dilemma for Hong Kong - the necessity of staunching the flow - and they deserve understanding for a decision that carries all manner of risks for their own future as 1997 nears. But it needs to be said clearly, too, that there is a longer term. That, in an age of wonders in the Communist world, involves a fresh Western approach to the heart of the matter, the hopeless poverty of <ENT>Vietnam<ENT>. Nobody should be too blithe here either. 
US<SEP>Many factories are working at only a fraction of capacity. However, in contrast to Nicaragua, where the economy has come close to collapse, in El Salvador both the additional costs of the war and increasing indebtedness have been counterbalanced by very large injections of aid from the United States. Since 1980, the economy, which has always been dependent on exports of a small range of agricultural products, especially coffee, has become highly dependent on <ENT>US<ENT> aid. This has equipped the army and paid much of the direct cost of the war. 
France<SEP>` We are not expecting miracles but we think we can do well. ` We are an improving team and the spirit is great. <ENT>France<ENT> will take us lightly and I'm not worried about the crowd. In a smaller stadium they will not be so passionate as they were when they beat the Americans in the final. " 
Iraq<SEP>Not only did it fail to achieve all the gains on which it seemed to be calculating in embarking on the assault, but it sustained one particularly debilitating blow in the course of it. Soon after the Iraqi onslaught, reports were received that Iraq's two southern oil-export terminals close to Fao at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab, Mina al-Bakr and Khor al-Amayyah, were under attack by Iranian warships. The two terminals and the Fao tank farm were put out of action, depriving <ENT>Iraq<ENT> of the normal means of exporting the output of its southern oilfields close to Basrah. Fortunately it still had its fields in the north, with their pipeline systems leading to Turkey and Syria. 
France<SEP>Labit kicked a cruel goal across the face of the wind. That made it 24-0 and the game effectively over and yet there were as many points to come. Two penalty goals by Donaldson preceded <ENT>France<ENT>'s fifth try, Galthie pouncing as the ball squirted from the side of Scotland's scrum. As Johnston said, it was bad luck on Dave Millard who had begun brilliantly and who, though eventually submerged by force of circumstances, had still shown Johnston a player he evidently never saw in Australia. 
New Zealand<SEP>Use the campaign outline above to plan a promotion of items for Mother's Day. 2 A butcher's shop is about to receive a delivery of spring lamb from <ENT>New Zealand<ENT>. Plan an advertising campaign for the meat. 
Britain<SEP>WILLIS IN JOBS PLEA ALAN LAW TUC chief Norman Willis appealed to bosses yesterday to get <ENT>Britain<ENT> back to work. The general secretary called on CBI head Howard Davies to build on his offer to work as the TUC's ` social partner ". 
UK<SEP>In this chapter we analyse the nationalized industries, explain how they have been run, and assess their performance. Then we discuss the case for privatization. Finally, we examine the <ENT>UK<ENT> privatization programme in practice. 
USA<SEP>A further round of talks on the future of the United States bases in the Philippines took place on Jan. 9-11. The current Military Bases Agreement, first signed in 1947 and governing US control of the Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base together with four smaller installations, was set to expire on Sept. 16, 1991. During the talks, the <ENT>USA<ENT> reportedly agreed to cede control over Clark and the four smaller installations, but differences remained over the future of Subic Bay. The Philippines government was said to have abandoned an earlier insistence on a five-year " terminal phase-out " period. 
US<SEP>Aides' night flight attracts heavy congressional fire. By Martin Walker in Washington THE US Secretary of State, Mr Jim Baker, yesterday sought to fend off the growing criticism of the new <ENT>US<ENT> initiative towards Beijing, arguing that the priorities were to prevent China from retreating further into isolation, and to show support for moderates in the government. ` And they are going to have to help us, if we are going to preserve this relationship, " Mr Baker said, signalling expectation of Chinese concessions on human rights. 
Equatorial Guinea<SEP>Membership: 7 countries - Benin, Burkina, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal - all of whom also belong to the wider ECOWAS. Main 1990 meetings: no summit meetings; these are normally biennial, the last was held in Cotonou, Benin, in October 1989, and the next was due in Niger in 1991. Other organizations: Gambia River Development Organization (OMVG), grouping The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, held 18th ministerial meeting, Dakar, Senegal, October; Senegal River Development Organization (OMVS), headquartered in Dakar and grouping Mali, Mauritania and Senegal, held 30th ministerial session, Bamako, Mali, July; Mano River Union, grouping Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, held 14th ministerial meeting, Conakry, Guinea, January; Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), grouping Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, held 7th summit, YaoundÃ©, Cameroon, February; prospective Gulf of Guinea Commission, a Nigerian initiative for a five-member institution for joint offshore resource management with Cameroon, Gabon, <ENT>Equatorial Guinea<ENT> and Sao TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe. Central Africa 
Vietnam<SEP>Vietnam and China had normalized diplomatic relations in November 1991 [ see p. 38574 ]. Vietnam and China signed agreements during Li's visit, guaranteeing foreign investment in each other's countries and encouraging economic, cultural and scientific co-operation. China also agreed to provide <ENT>Vietnam<ENT> with an interest-free loan equivalent to US$14,000,000. Despite the signing of the four agreements, a report in the Dec. 17 edition of the Far Eastern Economic Review said that the two sides had failed to resolve territorial disputes which had strained relations since normalization [ see pp. 39094; 39144 ]. 
Germany<SEP>Ferguson's chance to make fresh start By Hugh Keevins THE innocence of youth will give way to the pressures of adulthood when Duncan Ferguson plays against <ENT>Germany<ENT> at Ibrox tomorrow night, ending a nine-month period during which his future at the highest level looked in doubt. The Dundee United forward, compared to Joe Jordan in style by the national coach, Andy Roxburgh, yesterday, has, since September, been buffeted by bad publicity. 
US<SEP>Even in the decade following the 1973 oil crisis, official unemployment rates have never exceeded 3 per cent, compared to the double figure levels in the EEC or the US. International comparisons of unemployment rates are as notoriously difficult as measures of income distribution, and the Labour Ministry in Japan, as in other countries, has its own idiosyncratic style of creative statistical construction. There are studies by Japanese labour economists which suggest that if the <ENT>US<ENT> definition of unemployment were used in Japan, the unemployment percentage would at least double (Tominomori 1985). The common issue in disputing the accuracy of unemployment statistics concerns the under-recording of women who wish to take paid employment but do not register. 
Kuwait<SEP>By 1990 Baghdad had come to perceive these calculations as imperilled by two GCC states, Kuwait and the UAE. Both countries had been over-producing against their OPEC quotas for some time, helping depress prices gradually and giving rise to familiar bouts of recrimination between them and other member states with higher absorptive capacities for revenues. In addition, Iraq viewed <ENT>Kuwait<ENT> as having gradually eaten away patches of Iraqi territory in the border area between them over the years and also as draining reserves from part of Iraq's South Rumailah oilfield which straddled the frontier. Such were the charges levelled at Kuwait by President Saddam Hussein in his statements in mid-July 1990. 
BELGIUM<SEP>Doel reactors on the dole <ENT>BELGIUM<ENT> is pressing ahead with plans to generate half its electricity from nuclear power by 1985, despite a series of mishaps at the country's biggest concentration of nuclear power at Doel, near Antwerp. Three Westinghouse designed PWRs have been built there since 1974 and a fourth will be running by 1985. 
India<SEP>Although an indefinite curfew was reimposed in Srinagar after the assassination, thousands of people took to the streets as Farooq's body was carried from the hospital to which it had been taken to his home. As the cortege passed Srinagar's Islamia College precinct, Indian security forces opened fire on the mourners, killing at least 20 people on the spot; a further 27 people were subsequently killed, and according to some reports the death toll had reached 100 by the end of the day. After Farooq's assassination and the subsequent shootings, both <ENT>India<ENT> and Pakistan initiated substantial and aggressive troop movements, and The Hindu of May 31 reported that the two countries " came close to war " on May 22. The incident brought to an end a month-long period of peace in Kashmir, and dashed hopes of a reduction in the border tension. 
El Salvador<SEP>In 1986, there were an estimated 10,000 teachers without jobs and 800,000 school children without classrooms. The proportion of GDP devoted to education is the lowest in Central America: 1.4 per cent in 1986, down from 1.8 in 1980. This is lower even than <ENT>El Salvador<ENT> with 2.5 per cent, and 4 to 5 per cent for other Central American countries in 1986. In 1987, the coverage at primary level was 62.02 per cent. 
Italy<SEP>Mr Gordon Green, a senior executive member, said the recent educational changes were doomed to failure unless the Government recognised the true value of teachers implementing them by improving pay and conditions. An eight-point plan to beat teacher shortages was unveiled yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education spoksman, who accused ministers of being ` trapped in a torpor induced by ignorance " about the true nature of the crisis. Without urgent action, he added, British education would fall behind Spain, <ENT>Italy<ENT>, and Greece. 
France<SEP>The Big Four retained, and still possess, the power to decide the German Question, eventual reunification, and exercise joint supreme authority over Berlin. During the past 40 years the two Germanys have gradually come closer together economically while bolstering each other's separateness at the same time. The two formally recognised each other in May 1970 while Britain and <ENT>France<ENT> granted recognition to East Germany in February 1973 and the US in September 1974. Two years ago, Mr Erich Honecker, who succeeded Walter Ulbricht as East German leader in 1971, thought he had crowned the post-war settlement and division of Germany with the first official visit to the Federal Republic. 
South Korea<SEP>Some 27 PBq of radioactive material is stored in a " floating technical base " in the Arctic. Yablokov estimated that it would cost " several tens of millions of dollars " simply to assess how much radiation was being released from submerged waste. * <ENT>South Korea<ENT> and Russia are to carry out a joint survey to assess the damage caused by Soviet dumping of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan. Russia has welcomed the Korean contribution of experts, equipment and funds to finance the survey, expected to cost US$400,000, but has said it will have to continue dumping because it lacks the facilities or funds to process the waste on shore. 
United States<SEP>On the other hand, there was much to be commended in the way Britain relinquished the reins of empire. Beginning with the transfer of power in India and Pakistan in 1947, through the retreat from Egypt, and the rapid withdrawal from Africa in the Macleod period in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the rapidity and lack of tension with which Britain shed her imperial domain is perhaps the most notable of tributes to national stability and, possibly, maturity in the post-war world. There were few outcries by settlers, as in France with regard to Indo-China and Algeria, no crisis comparable with the chaotic fate of the former Belgian Congo, no agony approaching that of the <ENT>United States<ENT> over Vietnam. The curtain went down in dignity and tranquillity. 
United Kingdom<SEP>117. The Commission drew a distinction. It considered that if the Community's system of quotas in its present form allowed member states to introduce certain requirements whose compatibility with Community law could only be justified by the necessity to attain the objectives of that system, then such requirements could only be incorporated into the quota licences or other quota management measures which the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> must lay down for the management of its quotas under article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83, and not be imposed as conditions for the registration of vessels. Moreover, while restrictive licence conditions which might be justified under the present quota system might lose their justification if that system developed into a more integrated system for the management of fishery sources, the same would not be the case with restrictions on the registration of vessels. 
Cook Islands<SEP>The International Board decided not to separate England and Wales for the World Cup. Great Britain will compete alongside Australia, New Zealand, France, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Tonga and Fiji. South Africa, the <ENT>Cook Islands<ENT> and CIS are on stand-by. But Mills adds: ` We have been let down and treated badly. 
US<SEP>Israeli Defence Minister's visit to USA Israel's Defence Minister, Moshe Arens, arrived in Washington on July 20 for talks with US Defence Secretary Richard Cheney, in the highest-level contact between the two countries since Shamir's new coalition government took office the previous month [ see pp. 37546-47 ]. Arens's visit coincided with the US State Department's postponement of a session of a joint committee which co-ordinated the disbursement of US military aid to Israel, although the State Department denied that the intention was to indicate <ENT>US<ENT> dissatisfaction over Israeli policies. Arens said that the US side had indicated continuing support for the joint US-Israeli development of the Arrow surface-to-air missile programme, which involved the US company Lockheed, and on which the USA was underwriting 80 per cent of the costs. 
China<SEP>Chinese nuclear test A government spokesman confirmed on May 22 that China had conducted an underground nuclear test; evidence of a major nuclear explosion had been picked up by several monitoring stations the previous day. The yield was estimated at between one and two megatonnes, which made it <ENT>China<ENT>'s largest-ever nuclear explosion, exceeding by far the yields for tests carried out by other nuclear powers since the 1970s. Responding to criticism from neighbouring countries, including Russia, the Chinese authorities said that they had always exercised restraint in nuclear testing and that China was still committed to a complete ban on nuclear testing within the framework of effective nuclear disarmament. 
South Africa<SEP>In June Banda nominated new members of the National Assembly to fill vacant seats in constituencies in all three regions of the country. Relations with Zimbabwe continued to improve, with Banda invited as guest of honour to Zimbabwe's 10th anniversary celebrations in early 1990, and continued operation of the joint co-operation commission between the two countries. In June a new trade agreement, superseding a 1967 agreement, was signed with <ENT>South Africa<ENT>, providing for the duty-free entry into South Africa of all Malawian goods. 1990 ECONOMIC OVERVIEW 
Italy<SEP>Britain's was at 20 p.c. However, some delegates thought the figures were too generous. The tables in the study appeared to show that the pension paid in Greece was 381 ecus (Â£274) per month, placing Greek pensions above those for Portugal, Britain, <ENT>Italy<ENT>, and Spain. But Anastassios Ammallos from Greece said: ` We have very low pensions. 
Peru<SEP>Pancev has moved to Internazionale, Najdoski to Eintracht Frankfurt, Jugovic to Sampdoria, Mihajlovic to Roma, Belodedic to Valencia, Bolic to Galatasaray and Tanjga to Fenerbahce. Considering last year's sale of Prosinecki to Real Madrid, Sabanadzovic to AEK Athens, Stojanovic to Antwerp, Binic to Slavia Prague and Stosic to Real Mallorca, there can't be many players left on their staff! What's more, Vladimir Popovic, who took charge of Red Star last season, has quit to become national team manager of <ENT>Peru<ENT>. 
Britain<SEP>Denis Healey himself, a long-established whipping boy, now became almost popular, with his chairmanship of the International Monetary Fund inner steering committee making him a figure of greater eminence. Alongside his Chancellor, Callaghan emerged with more credibility in the international arena, especially through his pact with the West German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, and the partial decline in the reputation of the French President, Giscard d'Estaing. <ENT>Britain<ENT> seemed in almost bullish mood as 1977 went out. It seemed well on the way to revival, with the balance-of-payments surplus rising to Â£1,000 m. in 1978 and the pound, now a petro-currency, rising to not far short of $2 on the foreign exchange. 
Britain<SEP>At a time when nearly half of Britain's destroyers had been put out of action, he arranged with Winston Churchill to provide 50 over-age US destroyers in return for the leases on eight British naval bases in the American hemisphere. Encouraged by victory in the election, Roosevelt persuaded Congress to accept in March 1941 the Lend Lease scheme for supplying military and other goods to any nation whose defence the President considered vital to the United States. Lend Lease, by-passing the Neutrality Laws, became vital in aiding first <ENT>Britain<ENT>, and later the Soviet Union, in their resistance to Hitler. Congress allows the use of billions of dollars to lend and lease supplies throughout the war period. 
Britain<SEP>There was a hesitant start to Anglo-American co-operation in Germany. Bevin's distrust of Germany persisted even when circumstances within that country and growing distrust of the USSR produced moves designed to prevent communist gains outside the Soviet occupation zone, and to begin the recreation of a balance of power in the heart of Europe. Given <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s limited resources, dialogue with the United States became increasingly necessary. Thus the British Foreign Office, against Treasury objections, came to favour the fusion of the British and American occupation zones in Germany. 
USA<SEP>A number of Arab countries thought by the USA to possess or to be developing chemical weapons objected to mandatory, short-notice, on-site inspections, arguing that insufficient efforts were being made to ensure Israel's compliance with these procedures. US chemical weapons programme A Washington Post report of Oct. 9, 1989, quoted US administration officials as saying that a decision had been made during an unusually secretive policy review that the <ENT>USA<ENT> would continue to produce chemical weapons over a 10-year phaseout period after the conclusion of an international treaty to ban the weapons (see negotiations above). The " decision " followed Bush's initiative, unveiled at the UN General Assembly in September (for Bush and Shevardnadze speeches see pp. 36906-07) and which was at variance with the existing chemical weapons treaty draft, which called for an immediate halt to production. 
South Africa<SEP>His mother has received phone calls threatening her should her son play. Haynes says he will play. <ENT>South Africa<ENT>'s Omar Henry, who has had ` flu, is certain to miss the game. 
Ireland<SEP>` Are we as good as at war? " she asked, and there was no way of knowing whether she laughed or was alarmed behind the widow's veil. ` With this Glendower rampaging round Wales as free as a bird, and threatening Ruthyn every time Lord Grey turns his back? And urging on <ENT>Ireland<ENT> and Scotland to his help? Can you doubt it? " 
Britain<SEP>British Aerospace at Stevenage will be responsible for a larger weapon, with twice the range, to fit on armoured vehicles. Messerschmitt -Bolkow-Blohm in Germany will look after the development of a version of this missile to arm helicopters. The medium-range missile will replace the Franco-German Milan weapon, which <ENT>Britain<ENT> has also bought, from the early 1990s. The long-range type will succeed the British swingfire and the Franco-German Hot from the mid-1990s. 
Britain<SEP>Uniting them would merely compound their dollar deficits into a larger whole. Neither - importantly - did Britain share France's obsession with the German problem. If <ENT>Britain<ENT> had an interest in European co-operation it was as a way to withstand Soviet pressure and underpin British independence, not as a way to control Germany. In January 1949 the British cabinet ruled that co-operation with Europe should not be taken so far that it compromised Britain's ability to survive as an independent state. 
Pakistan<SEP>Perhaps the most interesting theory states that the physical door-hanging represents the spiritual doorway to the Islamic heaven, which has four gardens at its innermost core. Hatchli designs are found on Afghan village and workshop rugs, as well as on those woven by nomadic tribes (pl. 10). Soviet workshop Bokharas are sometimes produced in this design, and <ENT>Pakistan<ENT> has added the scheme to its Mori Bokhara range. It is much less common on Persian Turkomans. 
Denmark<SEP>The Danes are traditional dairy cattle breeders, but since the Second World War the dairy herds have followed the British trend towards fewer, larger units and a certain amount of land has become available for beef-rearing on a minor scale. The first beef breed in Denmark was the Aberdeen Angus, imported in 1950 from Scotland and later from Sweden as well, but veterinary restrictions prevented further imports except in limited numbers in recent years. Until 1967, all beef breeds in Scandinavia were registered by the Nordic Association of Beefbreeders but since that year <ENT>Denmark<ENT> has registered its own beef animals. The beef industry remains limited to suckler herds on marginal land or the use of commercial beef bulls on dairy cows. 
Kuwait<SEP>Saudi Arabia, supported by Kuwait and other GCC members, declined, suspecting that to agree would provoke internal tensions. The Saudis preferred to rely on their own defence capacity and that of their Arab allies. To reinforce this confidence, they had participated in GCC defence consultations a week or so before and joint manoeuvres with <ENT>Kuwait<ENT> the previous winter. One collective line of approach adopted by the GCC was to put forward a draft resolution to the UN Security Council, so worded as to highlight the Iranian role in endangering shipping, while remaining silent on that of Iraq. 
West Germany<SEP>Undoubtedly, EEC legislation to fit all new cars with catalytic converters by 1990 will help. Some countries are keener on being cleaner than others and it has been left up to the badly affected states of Europe to set the best example. Sweden, Austria and <ENT>West Germany<ENT> plan to cut total SO&sub2; emissions by between 65 and 70 per cent by the year 1995 and Sweden hopes to reach an 80 per cent reduction by the end of the century. Each year, Sweden spends Â£10 million on liming acidified lakes to neutralise acidity, but the programme is limited to 4,000 lakes and rivers. 
Israel<SEP>In a press interview with the Reuters newsagency on Feb. 14 the Israeli ambassador to the USA, Zalman Shoval, said that Israel was being " given the run-around " by the US administration over the guarantee; his remarks were described by Bush the following day as " outrageous ". When Baker finally signed the guarantees on Feb. 20, the Israelis insisted that they had not provided any records of settlement spending in the occupied territories. Instead, Levy had simply assured Baker that <ENT>Israel<ENT> would not use the US funding in the occupied territories, and would henceforth share information regarding settlement with US officials. Addition of Moledet to ruling coalition 
America<SEP>This aim was soon replaced by the ` liberation of Kuwait ". Now the declared objective is to ` free " Kuwait and to destroy the military capacity of Iraq. Yet how many times has <ENT>America<ENT> sided with Israeli aggression against the people of Palestine? How many times has America used its veto to maintain Israel's occupation of three Arab countries and to permit the continued killing of men, women, and children in occupied Palestine? 
Ghana<SEP>This was the situation as the Commonwealth leaders sought to find a formula. The best they could suggest was a Commonwealth exploratory mission. Nigeria and <ENT>Ghana<ENT> were to be participants. 
Israel<SEP>For example reference to God's creation by his eternal word and spirit removed. The idea that God directs the universe removed. The notion that the incarnation was to fulfil the promise to <ENT>Israel<ENT> and to reconcile the world with God removed. The fact that Jesus was obedient to the father's will removed. 
Moldova<SEP>Relations with Bulgaria and Romania The Presidents of Moldova and Bulgaria, Mircea Snegur and Zhelyu Zhelev, signed a 10-year friendship and co-operation treaty in Sofia on Sept. 7. A special clause guaranteed the rights of ethnic Bulgarians in Moldova, of whom there were 89,000 according to <ENT>Moldova<ENT> and 150,000-170,000 according to Bulgaria. Bulgaria and Moldova had established diplomatic relations in February 1992. 
Britain<SEP>The current project aims to produce and field test a French adaptation of the Nottingham Health Profile. In so doing, it is hoped to make a contribution to the methodology of cross-cultural research by overcoming linguistic problems involved in the translation of perceptions of health from one language to another; by identifying differences in the perceived severity of the items; and through the interpretation of cultural differences in scoring. It is envisaged that the successful completion of this project will provide an avenue for future collaboration in health research between France and <ENT>Britain<ENT>. 
Turkey<SEP>She has had to give in over the question of chrome: and the Foreign Minister, who never struck me as being too friendly towards us, failed to get away (as he apparently hoped) with letting armed German ships through the Straits. But, more recently, the opening of the Second Front, together with its initial success, has sent a faint thrill of alarm through the country: and the latest utterance of Cordell Hull, which carne over the wireless yesterday, is not going to cheer things up, nor is it likely to be the last exhortation of its kind. To say that this sums up <ENT>Turkey<ENT>'s attitude as a whole would nevertheless be untrue. Combined with their reluctance to enter the war, the Turks entertain great hopes of their army, upon which a major portion of the budget is spent: and they can not fail to recognise something ludicrous in an attitude which, at one moment, abhors the idea of fighting and at another lauds it as the noblest activity of man. 
South Africa<SEP>Hundreds of bullets were let loose - followed by tear-gas and even mortar shells - as protesters were cut down without mercy. The soldiers were from the black homeland of Ciskei. And their targets were supporters of the African National Congress, which has vowed to topple Ciskei's military leader - denouncing him as a puppet of white <ENT>South Africa<ENT>. The bloodbath will plunge the nation into a new crisis - and may wreck hopes of resumed talks on South Africa's future. 
Britain<SEP>The Iranian election is seen as an opportunity for President Rafsanjani to strengthen his pragmatic policy of seeking an accommodation with the West to restore Iran's economy. But Mr Rafsanjani is exposed to accusations that he is departing from the policies set out by the leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, and may have seized on the Mujahideen attacks to demonstrate that he is not selling out the imam's legacy. <ENT>Britain<ENT> has not yet received any formal demand for the extradition of the demonstrators who threw bricks at the Iranian embassy in London and smashed windows. There is no extradition treaty between Iran and Britain, though this does not rule out granting a request, if properly formulated.
