US<SEP><ENT>US<ENT> FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION REVIEWS STAFF REPORT ON ANTI-TRUST ALLEGATIONS The US Federal Trade Commission is reviewing a new staff report on the anti-trust allegations against Microsoft Corp, but a decision on the matter probably is still weeks away, lawyers familiar with the case told the Wall Street Journal: with a two-to-two vote in February, the commission didn't accept staff recommendations to seek an injunction preventing the company from using its market power to engage in allegedly unfair competitive practices; after the tied vote, the commissioners asked for more information in an effort to resolve the deadlock; the status report, which was delivered to commissioners last week, provides additional support for the staff's call for action. 
Norway<SEP>Why don't we do it? " and we all agreed rather tentatively that it might be a good idea. Well, unlike many of the promises that are made over the clinking of glasses and in the glow of a few drinks, and despite the fact that Pam and Tony lived near Thurso in the north of Scotland, Wendy was working in Bristol and I lived in Shetland, we got in touch later and laid firm plans for a trip to Lapland. We decided that we would like to spend much of our available time in the far north, beyond the Arctic Circle so, taking turns at driving and stopping only for fuel and occasional snacks, we thrashed on up the ` spine " of <ENT>Norway<ENT> through spectacular mountain scenery to Trondheim. Much of the country was wooded and the birds were not too obvious. 
UK<SEP>Thus the Long Gilt suffered a mild setback in 1988 and 1989 as the public sector finances moved from deficit to surplus and the Treasury instituted a " buy-back " programme for long-dated gilts. Partly due to this, the long end of the yield curve has been rather stable in the UK, and the need to hedge at this end of the term structure was diminished. However, turnover increased in 1990 due to <ENT>UK<ENT> entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which implied a shift in longer term inflationary expectations and a fortiori long rates of interest, combined with the fact that the public sector finances had moved back into deficit. The German Bund contract was strong from the outset, probably due to the previously unsatisfied demand for derivatives based on German bonds, but this has been strengthened considerably by the reunification of Germany and the resulting uncertainty about long term yields on German paper. 
France<SEP>Some of the books which he is known to have possessed, which included Christine de Pisan's Letter of Othea to Hector, a didactic work for knights, reinforce this view. At the same time Fastolf s attitude to the practicalities of war reflect a hardheadedness which was essentially of this world: the plan which he drew up in 1435 favouring a ` tough " approach to the war made little concession to romantic ideas of chivalry which would influence a knight's conduct in war. His long career in <ENT>France<ENT> which led him to hold high military and administrative posts, as well as amassing a fortune through the capture of prisoners in battle, the seizing of property and the exploitation of estates, shows him to have been a ` realistic " person in all that he did. As often the case, Froissart had a story which illustrates this point. 
UK<SEP>It was alleged by Clasper that the foreman had his knife in the young kid who was only doing his job. ` The foreman is out to get him " was the expression making the departmental rounds. Clasper and the conspirators timed the third offence to coincide with the visit to the <ENT>UK<ENT> of the President and Chief Executive Officer of United Motors, Nate Cocello, as this would provide maximum publicity to the planned strike. An attempt would then be made to drag Cocello into the dispute by Clasper making a public appeal to the President to reinstate the sacked shop steward over the heads of plant and divisional management. 
East Germany<SEP>The xenophobia and repression associated with Stalin's last years and the culmination of the personality cult belied the Soviet Union's internationalist pretensions. Even those who saw the extension of Moscow's control over her eastern European neighbours as primarily a response to American expansion objected to the oppressive form of Soviet rule. The successive rebellions against Soviet-backed regimes - in <ENT>East Germany<ENT> in 1953, in Poland and Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Poland in the early 1980s - progressively undermined the allegiance of foreign radicals to the USSR. This bristling empire built on the bones of peasants and political prisoners and denying the most fundamental rights to the workers themselves seemed more and more a mere mirror image of the capitalist system rejected by western radicals. 
Japan<SEP>He had based his electoral platform on the need for better relations with the United States. Political observers felt, however, that difficulties could still arise with the USA, because of his publicly expressed view that Japan's trade surplus was a " fundamentally insoluble problem " caused by unstoppable world demand for superior Japanese products, and would remain impervious to import tariffs or even major currency shifts. Miyazawa's recent calls for a period of renewed economic growth in <ENT>Japan<ENT> and for a cut in Japanese interest rates (implying a weakening of the yen and a growth in the trade surplus) were also received with concern in the USA. Miyazawa had also called during his election campaign for the political rehabilitation and " purification " of Japanese politicians who had been implicated, like himself, in the financial scandals of recent years. 
United States<SEP>The Kabul regime responded by reinforcing the garrison's 3,000-4,000 regular troops and by launching a high-altitude bombing campaign; Kabul-based Scud-missiles were also fired at rebel positions. An assortment of mujaheddin guerrillas were involved in the offensive, including supporters of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's fundamentalist Hezb-e Islami and Jalaluddin Haqqani's rival Hezb-e Islami (Yunis Khan faction). The rebels also reportedly received logistical support from the <ENT>United States<ENT> Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and its Pakistani counterpart, the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). The Afghan government claimed that artillery and infantry units of the Pakistan army had actually entered the battle at a decisive stage in late March. 
Great Britain<SEP>And Anthony and his, Anthony and his colleagues are going around, is it just England or are you going to Scotland and Wales as well?

UK<SEP>They believe that the current slaughter policy is a political expedient designed to allow ministers to show that they are doing something to curb food poisoning. The measures have little relevance to public health. The race is now on to show that the Government is wrong before the last bird in the <ENT>UK<ENT> is slaughtered. Even now it might be too late: imports are rushing in to replace the shortfall. 
Britain<SEP>The scale of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s overseas government expenditure was a source of intense debate at the time, and has remained a source of criticism of the Attlee government's policies. Was this a case of folie de grandeur, in which Britain's economic recovery was sacrificed to anachronistic (and unsocialist?) attempts to retain a great power stance in the world? 
Britain<SEP>THE most coveted trophy in North-East athletics history is to be auctioned at Christie's in London a week today. Organisers of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s oldest road race, the annual New Year's Day Morpeth to Newcastle event, will be surprised to discover that the original prize is up for sale at a special sporting memorabilia auction. It was presented, to Darlington Harrier Andy Campbell, when the race was established as an open event in 1904 and given to Duncan McLeod-Wright to keep when the Scottish runner became the first man to win three times, in 1929. 
Thailand<SEP>Unless you do I can not watch you. You are a god here. " Bill, 76, asked Street chiefs to investigate and they discovered that episodes of the popular show screened in Britain five years ago are now topping the ratings in <ENT>Thailand<ENT> and they have made Percy a national hero. Startled Bill, 76, said: ` At first I thought what a damned cheek sending me an electric bill. 
Japan<SEP>FROM OUR SOUTH-EAST ASIA CORRESPONDENT LIKE Korea, Singapore has economic problems that most other countries can only envy. Last year real GNP grew by 8.5%, and inflation was only 3.4%, lower than anywhere in Asia except <ENT>Japan<ENT> and Malaysia. Growth this year is expected to be a tolerable 5%. 
China<SEP>Jiang's visit was the first to Japan by a CCP general secretary since 1983. Release of details on political prisoner On April 7 the government disclosed information about one of <ENT>China<ENT>'s best-known political prisoners, Wei Jingsheng. One of the leaders of the Beijing Spring movement in 1978-79 which had created a " Democracy Wall " in the capital, Wei had been arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years in prison [ see pp. 30495-96 ]. 
United States<SEP>In addition, the very high demand in the early seventies may well have pushed up investment goods prices especially fast. It is certainly the case that the rapid increase in materials prices would tend to push up investment goods prices (which include an imported materials element) faster than output prices (which are defined to exclude the impact of import prices). Finally, some part of the fall in the output-capital ratio in the <ENT>United States<ENT> after 1966 must have reflected the decreasing capacity utilization. While it is impossible to measure precisely the influence of these factors, they all probably contributed to the falling output-capital ratio and the consequent decline in the profit rate. 
Singapore<SEP>FUJITSU SHOWS OFF TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED WITH SINGAPORE [hellip] Fujtisu Ltd is to demonstrate advanced information and communications systems at Asian Telecom 93, to be held in Singapore from May 17 to 22. The exhibition will include various technologies on which Fujitsu and the <ENT>Singapore<ENT> government have been working as part of the IT2000 plan, Singapore's comprehensive computing plan for the twenty-first century, which include south-east Asia's first B-ISDN service. B-ISDN field trials, conducted jointly by Fujtisu and Singapore, began in October 1992. 
Portugal<SEP>Knives were drawn during his two years with PSV in Holland. Now Robson's jeered off at Sporting Lisbon for losing a UEFA Cup tie. He's on £300,000 in <ENT>Portugal<ENT>, but for how long? Get yourself an air ticket, Bob! 
Switzerland<SEP>Mm Yeah. For example well I don' know which Swatch really but on Omega up for example there are Omega watches in Belgium which you can't buy in <ENT>Switzerland<ENT> Can't they? 
Japan<SEP>Kaifu reiterated the position of the Japanese government that the industrialized countries should not provide massive aid to the Soviet Union until there was greater evidence of a genuine commitment towards the creation of a market economy. Japan, moreover, was locked into a territorial dispute over the Soviet occupation of what the Soviet side called the southern Kurile islands, and what Japan called the northern territories, north-east of Hokkaido [ see p. 38148 ]. Bush accepted an invitation from Kaifu to visit <ENT>Japan<ENT> in late November 1991. A visit scheduled for earlier in the year had been postponed because of the Gulf war. 
Switzerland<SEP>Cautious by nature, they have missed money-spinning opportunities in new businesses like portfolio insurance and financial derivatives. New markets should help them to catch up. <ENT>Switzerland<ENT> already has a two-year-old automated futures and options exchange for blue-chip stocks called SOFFEX. Now it is the stockmarkets' turn for electronic treatment. 
Britain<SEP>ENOUGH electricity to light Basingstoke is being wasted every night by people too lazy to switch off their remote control televisions at the mains. A television turned off by remote control continues to use a quarter of normal power because it needs to be electrically awake to receive the next remote signal to switch back on. There are 14 million remote control televisions in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. At least half are believed to be switched off by remote control every night. 
Indonesia<SEP>A counterview, however, saw the developments simply as the successful outcome of local initiatives by Soviet diplomats. The Soviet Union, for its part, was reportedly attracted by the potential of the Indonesian domestic market and, specifically, by the possibility that restraints on Indonesian military spending might lead to a shift in procurement away from Western armaments to less expensive Soviet ones. Some difficulty was caused in relations with the USA in February 1990 when Bush intervened (in a letter to Suharto) over a commercial competition between the US AT&T company and Japan's NEC for the contract to modernize <ENT>Indonesia<ENT>'s telephone exchange system. The contract, which was reportedly worth about $2,000 million when re-orders were taken into account, was open to tender but the USA feared that Japan would apply pressure via its aid relationship for preferential treatment for NEC. 
US<SEP>Norton's other trump card was more recherché. For two decades, the brilliant engineer David Garside has worked at Norton's Shenstone factory perfecting his design of a rotary engine. While around him the motorcycle industry crumbled, Garside's technology gave Norton a small but profitable business producing rotaries for unmanned aeroplanes (` drones "), largely for the <ENT>US<ENT> Defense Department. Invented in 1951, the rotary engine is a revolutionary concept in internal combustion, feature a single large, long, wedge-shaped piston fixed directly to the crankshaft and driven around the cylinder. 
Papua New Guinea<SEP>Yearning for turquoise seas and sunshine skies, or just suffering from mid-winter blues? Liz Jones's hand-dyed silk scarves, swimming with shoals of brightly coloured tropical fish, will enliven any grey March day. Inspired by the coral coasts of <ENT>Papua New Guinea<ENT> (where Liz lived and worked for nine years), this aquarium on silk is made by using a rubber-based glue called gutta in the same way that wax is used in the batik process. Choose from an assortment of shapes, sizes and colours and order from Liz (who works from a cottage near Evesham) on 0386-871159. 
Belgium<SEP>After having amassed around 200 hours on the Corsair since purchasing it in 1982, the novelty of flying this beast has not diminished: ` Today I feel that every flight in the Corsair is as exciting as the first, mainly because with the Corsair you can not afford to be complacent, as the aircraft will sometimes bite back, so I have to be alert all the time while I am flying ". During Lindsey's ownership, pilots other than himself and John Allison have flown the aircraft. In 1983 John Watts, then an up­and-coming warbird pilot, flew the aircraft at that year's Biggin Hill Air Fair, and later took the aircraft out to a display in <ENT>Belgium<ENT>. After completing the airshow routine, John was on the homeward flight back to the UK when he ran into bad weather. 
Slovakia<SEP>Conservation: Land Development threatens Slovakia's mountains Czechoslovakian ecologists are launching a campaign to prevent large areas of national park land in <ENT>Slovakia<ENT>'s Tatra mountains from being developed by an American company as a sports and tourism complex. The development is being carried out under the aegis of the Slovak republican government. 
USA<SEP>Expertise is contingent, socially manufactured. In the British and the American cases it is as necessary to contextualise the production of knowledges about the inner city as it is to unpack the glossary of terms of urban regeneration used in contemporary political discourse. The Ford Foundation was interested in a specific agenda in funding philanthropically inclined research into urban crisis in the <ENT>USA<ENT> in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the early 1980s in Britain, the Economic and Social Research Council funded a major research project which lent an official academic seal to the work of individuals concerned. 
America<SEP>It's not right to call it a boulder problem; it has 16 moves and is 25 feet long. That's not a boulder problem by any means as far as I'm concerned ". Moon is sceptical of Tribout's claims for Just Do It at Smith Rock in <ENT>America<ENT>. He has not visited the cliff, but questions the Frenchman's ability to climb at the highest levels. 
UK<SEP>Radiation doses. The radiation doses received by classified workers in the <ENT>UK<ENT> for 1986 are analysed in Central index of dose information, published by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Health and Safety Executive. The first in a series of annual analyses, the document is available price £5 from HMSO and booksellers. 
Poland<SEP>He coughed again - the same painful choke and wiped the saliva from his lip. ` He knew he was betrayed by someone in MI6. He knew, and he tried to get out of <ENT>Poland<ENT>. " Blanche sat motionless, afraid to move in case Swod understood the value of the information he was giving her. 
El Salvador<SEP>In Defiance of Tradition: The Women's Organizations <ENT>El Salvador<ENT> has no history of an organized feminist movement. Women were granted the vote and given equal citizenship for the first time in the 1950 Constitution. 
south Korea<SEP>Rhee reacted by toning down his recent criticisms of the Americans and he urged that a small force be left in south Korea until the south could defend itself effectively. The United States wished to secure a transitional period in which limited American military and economic aid would be extended to south Korea in the hope that the communists would be kept at bay, at least for a decent interval. The role of the UN would be to supervise elections, if possible throughout Korea but if not in <ENT>south Korea<ENT> alone, and to afford some measure of protection to the infant state as it moved to independence. The United States began consultations with friendly powers in October letting it be understood that a UN temporary commission would be proposed, charged with supervising elections and reporting back to the UN Security Council and General Assembly at Lake Success. 
Belgium<SEP>The Franks The Franks, over whom Charlemagne came to reign in the year 768, were originally a loose confederation of Germanic tribes. By the sixth century they had begun to force their way into Gaul (France and <ENT>Belgium<ENT>), and there they eventually settled. The modern name of France comes from the word frank, though the characteristics of the early Franks were very far removed indeed from those of the modern French peoples. 
Hungary<SEP>Member states continued to experience high oil prices following the Soviet decision to cut oil supplies [ see p. 37630 ] and the outbreak of the Gulf crisis. It was reported on Nov. 27 that the Soviet Union had offered Hungary only 1,000,000 tonnes of oil for 1991, against a scheduled total between 4,000,000 and 4,500,000 tonnes. Although Hungary's trade surplus with the Soviet Union was expected to total more than US$1,000 million by the end of 1990, it was estimated that the introduction of world market prices for Soviet oil exports would contribute to a US$1,500 million deterioration in <ENT>Hungary<ENT>'s current account in 1991. On Oct. 29 the Soviet Union agreed to speed up oil deliveries to Yugoslavia, expected to total about 6,000,000 tonnes in 1990. 
UK<SEP>The entry and exit of firms is central to any discussion of the state of competition in UK markets. Entry, in particular, brings a force of discipline to bear upon existing firms, and is also frequently an important source of the new ideas which promote dynamism in industries. This project will analyse a hitherto unavailable data source on new entry and exit in all <ENT>UK<ENT> manufacturing industries for the period 1973-1981. The goal of the project is to examine the causes and consequences of entry and exit in the UK. 
United States<SEP>In the same year Philips launched CD-A, player sales topped 350,000 and over 1,250,000 discs were sold. In 1990, estimates suggest about 50 million players and around 350 million discs were sold worldwide. The Record Industry of America's figures show that CD-A disc sales in the <ENT>United States<ENT> have remorselessly overhauled and eroded sales of vinyl recordings and are rapidly catching the booming cassette market. They are in millions of US$ at retail prices. 
China<SEP>The Chinese side had ordered that construction be halted until the project received China's approval, saying that China had not been consulted on the matter, and expressing concern that it would place a financial burden on the new government after 1997. A Chinese Vice-Premier, Wu Xueqian, said on Jan. 15 that in the transition period up to 1997 " only the central people's government can, and is entitled to, speak on behalf of the people of Hong Kong ". According to the Hong Kong magazine Liaowang, the Chinese position reflected orders from Deng Xiaoping, <ENT>China<ENT>'s " elder statesman " leader. Wilson had responded with a statement saying that the administration of Hong Kong was currently the responsibility of the United Kingdom and the Hong Kong government, and declaring that construction of the project would go ahead. 
Iceland<SEP>So much lava flowed into the Skaftar valley that it was completely filled and lava began to spill out over the surrounding countryside. [ See Fig. 3 ] The long-term results of this eruption were profound: it proved to be <ENT>Iceland<ENT>'s worst ever disaster. We'll see why later. 
Federal Republic of Germany<SEP>Governmental and political involvement The spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated: in 1972, 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas, a decade later the number was 144 (WEC 1985). In most countries, the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people: the early development of the Green Party in the <ENT>Federal Republic of Germany<ENT> is something of an exception. Such a commitment to the environment is, none the less, both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing, let alone forthcoming, environmental problems. 
North America<SEP>In future, gene transfer could greatly increase the possibilities for improved crop performance, not simply by increasing yield, but also by modifying other characteristics. One example is the research into the proteins in the wheat grain on which bread baking quality largely depends, particularly the gluten fraction responsible for the elasticity of the dough. Gluten is deficient in many high yielding varieties of wheat used in Britain, local flour being fortified by the addition of high gluten varieties imported from <ENT>North America<ENT>. If suitable genes for gluten production could be added to British varieties, or if the genes in British wheat were made to produce more or better gluten, imports would be saved and farmers would get a higher price for a better quality wheat.

Sri Lanka<SEP>Women organise to combat violence Freedom from Violence - Women's Strategies from Around the World, is a new publication from the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). It tells the stories of women organising to combat gender violence in <ENT>Sri Lanka<ENT>, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and the USA. From a cross-cultural perspective, Freedom from Violence, shares their sources of inspiration and common threads of agreement about what needs to be done to confront the violence in women's lives in all its aspects: physical, social, economic, cultural and legal. 
Luxembourg<SEP>Brownies There are two Guide Associations in <ENT>Luxembourg<ENT> - the Association des Girl Guides Luxembourgeoises and the Letzeburger Guiden (Catholic Girl Guides). In 1958 they signed an agreement to form the Bureau de Liaison des Associations Guides du Luxembourg. 
United Kingdom<SEP>The Channel Islands and Isle of Man do not now suffer any special UK deemed domicile penalties. It should be noted that the above rules are often referred to as the 17 year rule and the 3 year rule. One normally thinks in terms of the 3 year rule as applying to a person who emigrates from the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> whilst one considers that the 17 year rule is applicable to someone who becomes resident in the United Kingdom whilst retaining his overseas domicile under general principles. However, when someone leaves the United Kingdom one must think in terms of both rules. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>General Practitioner Budgets Mrs. Gorman To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will consider extending the opportunity for general practitioners in <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT> to manage their own budgets immediately.

Solomon Islands<SEP>In the museum display of these materials (such as the treasures of Tutankhamun's tomb), stress may be laid on the objects' discovery by British archaeologists, thereby helping to legitimize the implicit pseudo-evolutionary claims of historical advance as civilization (Gidri 1974). This may also have positive consequences. The <ENT>Solomon Islands<ENT> is a new nation-state which may have been created through the imposition of an arbitrary boundary, but has to exist as a viable institution within the modern world. One of the constraints it suffers is the dominance of a history which tends to be reduced to that of either missions or colonial discovery, with the implications that the Solomon Islanders themselves were a stagnant and unchanging people prior to the arrival of Europeans, a view reinforced by some of the dominant synchronic traditions in social anthropology. 
America<SEP>" They emigrated. There were about 400 people emigrated in 1863. " John Campbell, aged 52, a cottar at Giol, said at one time there were nine tenants there who went to <ENT>America<ENT> about 32 years since [ 1860 ], there were at least six in Grastle and Tockmal. " When asked " Were they forcibly evicted, or did they go of their own free will? " he answered " Some left voluntarily owing to the poor markets. " 
US<SEP>The first two Cadillacs started with but one pull of the crank handle, the third took two turns. The cars were then each driven 500 miles at Brooklands without adjustment of any kind, averaging 34mph. The Dewar Challenge Trophy - awarded for the most meritorious performance of the year in any trial under the Long-Distance Trials Regulations - was presented to Cadillac that year, the first time the trophy had been won by a <ENT>US<ENT> car maker. After lengthy negotiations, which kept raising the price, an over-extended General Motors paid $4.5 million for Cadillac in 1909, and then used the good name of Leland and Cadillac to borrow more money to expand its empire further. 
UK<SEP>A rather more serious issue, involving the Secretary of State, has been the treatment of the very large users of electricity. Their complaint has been that, so far at least, the market mechanism has not proved effective for such large volumes - British Steel, for example, spends £100 million annually on electricity, and ICI accounts for 2%-3% of all consumption in the UK. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) has claimed on their behalf that on such volumes, <ENT>UK<ENT> prices were raised prior to privatisation above the levels enjoyed by overseas competitors. The Government allowed users a price cap as a transitional measure, but it has run only for a year, until March 1991. 
UK<SEP>Property. London & Metropolitan reported that losses before tax fell from £100.3m to £26m in 1991. The group's <ENT>UK<ENT> bankers have agreed to extend its loan facilities for another year until June 1993. Conglomerates. 
Britain<SEP>Tinker, tailor, soldier, swot Danny Connolley wonders where intelligent inquiry ends and espionage begins SERGEI V. IVANOV, the Russian diplomat declared persona non grata on the eve of All Fool's day was a danger to <ENT>Britain<ENT> because he is a purpose built hi-tech spy. In my view, Ivanov probably did not spy, in the conventional sense, during his 18 months in Britain, simply because he managed to produce spectacular results for his employers without subterfuge. 
Hungary<SEP>It is hoped that they will keep the client in power, but today, as in Stalin's day, additional measures are thought necessary to guarantee that the client remains reliable himself. A prime instrument of Stalin's domination, the ` Embassy system ", installed Soviet ambassadors as viceroys over their dependencies, supported by legions of Soviet ` advisers ". In the post-Stalin years, the Soviet ambassador has remained a figure of enormous importance (hence the key roles assumed by Andropov in <ENT>Hungary<ENT> and Chervonenko in Prague in the respective crises of 1956 and 1968). In contrast, very little business of substance is transacted through Moscow's resident NSWP ambassadors, whose postings are little more than sinecures. 
USA<SEP>UNKNOWN This is a survey of attitudes towards civil and political rights in Britain based upon over 2000 interviews with the general public and over 1000 interviews with a political and governing elite, namely, party group leaders on local government councils throughout Britain. The study is linked with similar recent or concurrent studies in Australia, Canada and the <ENT>USA<ENT> . The British study uses an innovative survey research methodology based upon CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing).

Germany<SEP>The economic and social instability of Eastern Europe seems likely to be a major political factor over the medium-term future, but it is far from being the only element of instability in the present world system. Thus, nationalism has re-emerged also in Western Europe, in neo-fascist and populist forms, directed frequently against immigrants and potential immigrants (and immigration itself is in part a consequence of the extreme poverty of some Third World countries, and of the economic decline of Eastern Europe). Uncontrolled population growth, the continuing deterioration of the environment, the economic depression in the major capitalist countries, the shift of economic power from the US to Japan and the European Community (and particularly to <ENT>Germany<ENT>) and the growing tensions between these three centres, the increasing disparity of wealth between the poorer developing countries and the industrial nations, are all potent sources of social dislocation and instability. Far from having reached the sunny uplands of history, as some have claimed, therefore, human beings will perhaps have to face, even in the present generation, new trials on a bleak and inhospitable mountainside. 
Britain<SEP>Read in studio A gas-fired power station is to be built at Didcot alongside the existing coal fired power station.

Italy<SEP>Roche agony FORMER Tour de France champion Stephen Roche last night revealed the agony behind his decision to retire admitted the pressure cycling exerted on his family life prompted his decision to retire the end of next season. The 32-year-old Irishman said his struggle to return to the form which won him the world title and Tours of France and Italy in 1987 his 1987 level, when he won a world title and the Tours of France and <ENT>Italy<ENT>, had placed strains on his family.

UK<SEP>Among its specific requests, it calls on governments to:, transfer resources from military expenditure to disaster relief, double family planning services, write-off official debts of low-income countries, reduce the use of fossil fuels, tighten safety standards in hazardous industries, create a market for forest products from sustainable sources. Published in book form, it covers in detail questions of pollution, waste management, transport, education, food and fisheries, climate change, child mortality and sanitation. Caring for the Earth was launched by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh (WWF-UK's President), and endorsed by the Archbishop of York, John Habgood, Sir Crispin Tickell (the <ENT>UK<ENT>'s former Ambassador to the UN). The WWF also launched a Caring for the Earth Campaign for Change, seeking pledges from individuals to make personal contributions to the strategy's goals over the next year by using energy-efficient light bulbs, cutting car mileage by 25 per cent, planting 10 trees and helping to organize recycling initiatives at their workplace. 
Thailand<SEP>Vang Shur, the secretary-general of the rebel United Front for the National Liberation of the Lao People (ULNLF), announced to reporters on Dec. 15, 1989, that his resistance forces, claimed to number 10,000, had scored many military successes " against the Vietnamese-backed Kaysone government " and now controlled many villages and remote areas in northern Laos. Thai intelligence sources confirmed the existence of several small resistance groups in Laos but could not confirm the extent of Vang's claims. On Dec. 21 the Lao ambassador to <ENT>Thailand<ENT>, Khamphan Simmalavong, denied claims by rebel forces that on Dec. 13 Gen. Vang Pao, who had commanded a force of Hmong tribesmen financed by the US Central Intelligence Agency until he had fled to the USA in 1975, had returned to Laos. Vang Pao had earlier told the Bangkok Post newspaper of the formation of a " revolutionary government of Laos " which had established itself in Laos and which he had visited on certain occasions. 
Sweden<SEP>But although these advantages soon overcame the early handicap of Silesia's remoteness from markets, in 1900 the Ruhr still produced nine-tenths of Germany's coal. It was in the United Kingdom and Germany that the mature industrial complex was furthest developed. Russia was later to exploit her mineral advantages and other countries were to be linked to this mass of industrial power as was, for example, <ENT>Sweden<ENT> as a supplier of iron ore, but heavy industry was in 1880 mainly concentrated in western Europe. Most of it lay in Great Britain, in a northern belt running from Lens and Lys in France across Belgium to the Ruhr, and in the Lorraine-Saar­Luxembourg region. 
Antarctica<SEP>In October 1990, the British Antarctic Survey recorded a daily value as low as 132 Dobson units. This was unexpected as previously ozone losses had tended to follow a two-year cycle, with shallower holes evident in even-numbered years. The two-year cycle was believed to reflect the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), a 26-month cycle in which the winds in the lower stratosphere of the tropics alternate between easterlies and westerlies, affecting the size and stability of the polar vortex around <ENT>Antarctica<ENT>. In October 1991, satellite sensors recorded a minimum of 110 Dobson units - the lowest reading in the 13-year record of satellite data. 
Britain<SEP>Teaching report: The parents of former Heighington Primary School teacher Catherine Lee visited the village last week to tell villagers how she was getting on in her third year teaching in East Africa. Miss Lee is at Nwanza, in Tanzania, with the Church Mission Society and will come home for a holiday in <ENT>Britain<ENT> next year. 
Ireland<SEP>There is a strong case for arguing that the dominance of Roman catholic high clergy in the determination of key value ingredients in catholic - nationalist consensus in the South is in a state of change, and that certain aspects in particular are being challenged. From the 1950s onwards there was considerable improvement to the standard of living. As <ENT>Ireland<ENT> opened up to foreign investment under de Valera's successor, Sean Lemass, another element in the value structure came to prominence, namely the obligation to achieve and retain full employment within the context of a modernized economy and a satisfactory level of housing, welfare, and medical care for all. The economic growth of the 1960s and early 1970s came to grief because of the western economic slump of the last decade and the massive increase in the Southern population. 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam<SEP>Major international affiliations: ADB; NAM. POLITICAL SYSTEM The <ENT>Socialist Republic of Vietnam<ENT> was proclaimed in 1976 after North Vietnam-backed communist insurgents had reunified the country in April 1975 by overthrowing the United States-supported government of South Vietnam after some 16 years of war. Under the terms of the 1980 Constitution legislative power is vested in a 496-member National Assembly (Quoc Hoi) elected for a five-year term, which elects a Council of State (the collective presidency) and a Council of Ministers headed by a Chair. 
Britain<SEP>The characteristic feature of power elite rule in liberal democracies is its selectiveness. While many run-of-the-mill domestic issues may be left open for policy debate and political influence to decide, in every liberal democratic country the core executive monopolizes major issues such as defence and foreign policy resolution, or critical economic decisions (the dark or secret side of the state). For example, in <ENT>Britain<ENT> successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers from 1948 though to 1979 developed the British nuclear deterrent in virtually complete secrecy, with no parliamentary or media discussion until decisions were accomplished facts, and even without disclosing decisions made to most of their fellow Cabinet ministers (Freedman, 1980). Some democratic elite theorists have argued that a much wider group of elected political leaders play political or policy direction roles than the power elite conception implies. 
Britain<SEP>Many in the industry felt it was worth while taking risks on the peak space heating load, by keeping prices sufficiently low to attract in addition such off-peak evening or spring and autumn space heating loads, as well as the cooking and water heating sales. Others (who were more justly accused of commercial megalomania or electrical messianism by critics) felt that the ` all-electric " future was near at hand, and that it was only a matter of time before all heating - continuous or intermittent - would be by electricity. The crux of the debate was whether this was the most cost-effective way of meeting the demand for heating in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, 7 and the Boards were under considerable pressure from the Government to justify their commercial policy, which seemed to be attracting peak loads at uneconomic prices. We have seen the deep resentment of the chairmen at Gaitskell's imposition of the Clow differential, which was an attempt to create a pricing structure which reflected the higher winter peak costs (pp. 36-8, above). 
Latin America<SEP>I want to end by saying that we need now to f go over this hurdle of liberation make sure that the vast majority of black South Africans who are deeply angry and I saw this anger because I was in South Africa when Chris was assassinated and this anger was turning into rage and the country was on a knife edge it could have blown up, the country would have burned had it not been for the diplomatic achievement of, of enormous stature by Nelson Mandela when he addressed the whole nation and in a sense seized power informally from white and black and the country managed to survive that but if that anger turns into rage again then the country could burn and I don't say this to be dramatic but just to warn that in those moments when the media and so on don't explain the situation well don't forget our people because they have had to cope with this situation. We have to then work in the future not only to develop South Africa but to develop the region Angola, Mozambique, all the other countries. We do not want to have a future relationship of United States and <ENT>Latin America<ENT> reproduced in South Africa, which so many people talk about now when they talk about South Africa as the engine of growth if we have that kind of growth it'll be distorted and none of the poor in South Africa or the region will benefit from it. So we need then to move forward and next week Archbishop and Julius, the founders of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in nineteen fifty nine are having a conference in London which we've entitled Southern Africa Making Hope a Reality. 
USA<SEP>Fingerspelling does not, therefore, stand alone as a system but has in most cases become part of sign language for adult deaf People. There are educational approaches where it has been used as a method. The ` Rochester " method of fingerspelling with speech and lip-reading has been in use in the <ENT>USA<ENT> for over a hundred years (Savage, Evans and Savage, 1981). Interestingly, this system was initially supported by the oralist lobby (Bell, 1887).

Isle of Man<SEP>Macmillan Anita Burgh Overtures 23rd July, £14.99 P.o.s.: colour poster; musical mug Media coverage: reviews in Prima, Essentials, Woman & Home; reviews and features in Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Mail on Sunday; regional radio interviews in Wales, Bristol, Cambridge, Cornwall, Manchester, Solent, Nottingham, West Midlands, Devon, Bedfordshire, Northern Ireland, Surrey, Sussex, <ENT>Isle of Man<ENT> and British Forces Radio. 
Germany<SEP>The failure of the Prussian and German people to follow the successful example of the French in a revolution from below meant that in 1870 they were forced to accept the unification of Germany by the reactionary Junker powers. That is, a revolution from above, a revolution guided not by the ambition of the bulk of the population, but by the interests of the landed aristocracy and the military. The unification of <ENT>Germany<ENT> protected the lifestyle of the Prussian Junkers - indeed, the Junkers' need to protect themselves and their lifestyle from the disrupting effects of outside economic competition through the creation and extension of a tariff union had been one of the major components in the formation of the German state. The Junkers, by leading the German unification, were able to enshrine their own position. 
South Africa<SEP>The first is to try and bring out some perceptions of the problems of Primary Health Care implementation in South Africa and, in particular, the Apartheid System's impact on implementation. The second is, in view of the current and apparent future changes in the country, to assess whether insights from other countries in the neighbourhood could offer any lessons. It is hoped that the analysis and insights from these other countries (viz. Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Nigeria) may serve to stimulate introspection from PHC enthusiasts from within <ENT>South Africa<ENT>, including the staff of the Health Services Development Unit (HSDU) which has been my source of inspiration. Most of my PHC experience has been gained through HSDU. 
Aruba<SEP>GDP per capita: US$12,125 (1988). Currency: Aruban guilder (or florin) (US$1.00=AFl1.7900 as at Oct. 29, 1990). <ENT>Aruba<ENT> acquired separate status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986, pending full independence in 1996. The form of government is embodied in the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which came into force in 1954. 
Italy<SEP>The punitive expedition of a Merovingian monarch was not quickly forgotten. Frankish Kings could be as brutal as Euric had been in the days of Visigothic expansion. With the conquest of Burgundy, the Frankish take-over of Gaul was almost complete; three years later the Ostrogoths, under enormous pressure from the Byzantine invading forces in <ENT>Italy<ENT>, handed over Provence to ensure peace with the Franks. The Merovingian kingdom was firmly established. 
Poland<SEP>At the 240th plenary of the Conference of the Episcopate held in Warsaw between April 30 and May 2, 1990, the Roman Catholic Church called for the restoration of religious education (abolished under Communist rule). A meeting between a church team led by Bishop Tokarczuk of Przemysl and Jacek Abroziak, the head of the Office of the Council of Ministers, on this and other issues, was reported on May 18. On Nov. 23, 1989, Mgr Jozef Kowalczyk arrived in Warsaw as the first Vatican nuncio to <ENT>Poland<ENT> since 1945. The move followed the Polish government's July restoration of diplomatic relations with the Vatican [ see p. 36830 ]. 
United States of America<SEP>He characterised the denial of such access to both superpowers as ` an act of non-alignment ". Soviet leaders were willing to support such a conception of non-alignment when it hindered the Western states. After the Egyptian leader, Sadat, granted the United States rights to use certain of Egyptian military facilities at the beginning of the 1980s, notably at Ras Banas on the Red Sea, Soviet writers described his ` preparedness to allow military bases for the armed forces of the <ENT>United States of America<ENT> on his territory " as being ` in violation of the basic principles of the Non-Aligned Movement ". This development particularly concerned Soviet leaders, although Egypt reserved for itself the right to exercise sovereign control over these facilities. 
UK<SEP>For about 15 years Lindsey averaged 20 airshows per season with the ` 108, and the aircraft has probably participated in more airshows than any other UK warbird. Lindsey reckons that he is the most shot down pilot in the world, after all, until the appearance on the UK airshow circuit of Spanish-built Messerschmitt ` 109s " (Ha 1112MIL Buchons) in 1988, Lindsey had the only German ` fighter " available. Over the years of flying at almost every conceivable airshow location in the <ENT>UK<ENT>, Lindsey has had a few unusual requests along the way: ` I can remember a certain airshow organiser, who was very active on the airshow scene then, but not now, coming up to me and saying ` Lindsey, how much do you want to bail out at the end of one of these dogfight routines that you do? ", I then replied, ` Well, what about my aircraft? ", to which he replied: ` It crashes doesn't it, that's the whole point! ". 
US<SEP>The first military operations were launched by Task Force Atlantic, charged with securing the canal itself. Special Forces seized control of the main dams on the canal, and prepared landing grounds for the helicopter-borne troops who came in to block the roads and defend the canal against guerrilla attacks from the pro-Noriega armed militia, the Dignity Battalions. Simultaneously, Task Force Semper Fidelis, composed of US marines and military police, seized the main road across the canal, the Bridge of the Americas, and secured the approaches to Howard Air Force Base, which was always under <ENT>US<ENT> military control. Almost immediately afterwards, Task Force Bayonet, the armoured force, headed into the centre of Panama City. 
US<SEP>Last year BPB achieved £202.3m. Grand Metropolitan remained impressed by the thought that it could be Sir James Goldsmith's next target, The shares rose 6p to 604p. The Whitbread brewing group was ruffled by stories it would be forced, under US legislation, to sell its <ENT>US<ENT> drink importing operations if it continued a trans-Atlantic restaurant build-up. The ` A " shares fell 6p to 375p. 
UK<SEP>SHERWOOD, who make sexy lace bras and knickers, is showing a fuller figure. Half-year profits rose by a quarter to £8.2 million, despite the slump. The firm, named after Sherwood Forest, has cornered the <ENT>UK<ENT> frillies market and has pulled its socks up and become Britain's biggest sock maker. It makes one in every three pairs sold in Marks & Spencer. 
Britain<SEP>The Archivo project encompasses some 9,000,000 pages. New data resources are also being produced by the analysis or synthesis of other written or artifact records. These include Genet's prosopograhy of the members of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages (1988), the British Academy's Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (Matthews, pers comm), the image and text archive of greek pottery being created by the Beazley Archive (Kurtz 1993) and the Corpus of Romanesque Stone Sculpture in <ENT>Britain<ENT> and Ireland. These projects provide fundamental research tools and their creation does raise questions about storage, access, distribution, documentation, and support. 
Ethiopia<SEP>Eritrea In a cautiously worded announcement on May 29 Afewerki said that the EPLF would be setting up a provisional administration for Eritrea, but that this did not constitute a unilateral declaration of independence. The EPLF continued to demand a US-supervised referendum on independence from <ENT>Ethiopia<ENT>, but was flexible as to the timetable for this, he said. The EPLF would attend the conference to be held before July 1, but would not participate in any government subsequently formed. 
UK<SEP>Nuclear Power Computer software bugs threaten safety of UK nuclear power stations A back-up safety system for the <ENT>UK<ENT>'s nuclear power station controllers may not work properly because bugs in the computer software have not been eliminated, according to a former employee of the company that wrote the software. Bob Hodson-Smith warned Active Business Services (ABS) of Sheffield that the software, the Safety Related Plant Status Monitoring System or Status, had not been fully tested and that Nuclear Electric should be warned of the potential difficulties. 
Israel<SEP>The countries are divided into 6 categories as follows: low-income with GNP per capita up to $250 (34 countries); middle-income over $250 per capita (58 countries); industrialized countries (19); capital surplus oil exporters (3); and centrally-planned economies, communist countries (11). There are several anomalies in this classification. In the first place, while countries listed from 1 to 92 are in strict GNP per capita order, countries 93, 94 and 95 (South Africa, Ireland and Italy) all have lower per capita figures than 92 (<ENT>Israel<ENT>). No fewer than 14 middle-income countries have higher per capita figures than ` industrialized " South Africa, and 5 of these are ` richer " than Ireland. 
France<SEP>Cohn-Casson was born in 1882, not long after France's humiliation by the prussians. He had spent his life, as many of the French intelligentsia had, looking for a basis for order in society. <ENT>France<ENT> is a country which has grave doubts about its moral fibre; it sees its national character as being as permeable as a colander. It was for this reason that Léon Cohn-Casson became such a fervent advocate of a secular morality. 
US<SEP>Ideally there will be no defections from the allied coalition, and only Iraq will be actively engaged as an enemy force. It is Saddam Hussein, the barbarian at the gate, who will herald the new world order, if anyone does. His subtle military strategy - sending Scuds to Tel Aviv, opening the land battle by attacking the <ENT>US<ENT> forces, parking up the air force in Iran for future use - cold still transform the war. Significant defections from the coalition, or the active political defection of their populations, could the widening of the war, as he wants. 
Britain<SEP>The exceptions were in 1983 and 1987, when Britain grew by about two points faster than the rest. Roger Bootle, chief economist at the Midland Bank, argues that it will be difficult for Britain to grow much faster than its recession-hit EC neighbours. Imports would surge while exports stagnated, swelling <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s current-account deficit to unsustainable levels. A strong recovery in Britain would soon be cut short. 
Switzerland<SEP>So what is it doing in a book devoted to places off the beaten track in Switzerland? It is here for a number of reasons. Zurich is an essential part of one of the regions inviting exploration, north <ENT>Switzerland<ENT>, which tourists are inclined to pass through with no more than an approving nod, rather than lingering to find out. It is the most likely place of arrival and departure for most visitors from overseas. 
Spain<SEP>Among the symposia mooted is one in 1993 looking at new museum media for the millennium, organised with the Video Department of the Whitney Museum in New York. As yet most of the artists billed for exhibitions are non-Spanish, with high international profiles. Local artists will probably get a look in eventually, although there are other organisations such as the cultural foundation of the Caixa de Pensiones Bank which actively promote younger artists within <ENT>Spain<ENT>. The directors regard their non-Western art programme as a serious academic campaign. 
Australia<SEP>But now Japan is becoming a favoured target. In the space of a week no fewer than five North Harbour players of various stature announced they were leaving for substantial playing-working contracts in Japan, ranging from two to three years. The most prominent of these was Kevin Schuler, an All Black replacement in Wales and Ireland in 1989, a captain in the second-tier divisional side in 1991 and an All Black in <ENT>Australia<ENT> this year. Schuler went to Australia as a junior loose forward but, as the injury toll rose and his form improved, he won his first cap in the Second Test against Australia at Brisbane. 
US<SEP>The area is officially designated as one of outstanding natural beauty (AONB). The government's decision to press ahead with the work, allegedly without carrying out an adequate environmental impact assessment, led to a threat of legal action from the European Commission [ see ED no. 52 ]. Among the protestors were members of the <ENT>US<ENT> radical environmentalist group, Earth First!, currently establishing itself in Britain. Arrests were made as Earth First! members adopted the group's traditional tactics of direct action by chaining themselves to bulldozers. * The Department of Transport has rejected recommendations by its Standing Committee on Trunk Road Assessment (SCATRA) calling for more thorough assessments of the environmental impact of new roads. 
Rumania<SEP>In order to get some value for the $30 Rumanian border visa fee, we did a frantic but exciting car trip north to the Rumanian/Russian border. This part is pristine, untouched with vast forests, mountains and interesting people including original gypsies. On return to Hungary we stopped one night in Satu Mare, the last big frontier town in <ENT>Rumania<ENT>. The hotel there, expensive, in faded glory, rated 4 Star, had no hot water, no sink plugs, no toilet rolls and no breakfast because the chef did not turn up, probably accosting foreigners in the town square to change dollars like everybody else. 
West Germany<SEP>But the survey led nowhere, and was never repeated. Rather than producing a brave new economic world, the ECSC and its High Authority had constantly to wrestle with national objections and intransigence. It had, for example, to struggle with West Germany's complaints about a High Authority decision to allow French steel to be sold within <ENT>West Germany<ENT> with a lower level of taxation than that placed upon its own steel being sold in France. Again, by 1955 Belgian coal and Italian steel still enjoyed substantial national protection three years into the ECSC operation. 
Tanzania<SEP>Commonwealth position The nine-country Commonwealth Committee on South Africa met in London on Feb. 16 and decided to maintain all Commonwealth trade, financial and sporting sanctions pending the adoption of concrete steps by Pretoria to end apartheid. Ministers from Australia, Canada, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Nigeria, <ENT>Tanzania<ENT>, Zambia and Zimbabwe attended. They agreed to meet again in New Delhi on April 30 to consider an " appropriate response " depending on what progress the promised legislation had made. 
Holland<SEP>Milan march ITALY'S AC Milan maintained their impressive form with a 2-1 European Cup victory over PSV Eindhoven in <ENT>Holland<ENT>. They stormed into a 2-0 lead with goals from Frank Rijkaard and Marco Simone. 
Britain<SEP>One effect of this intended trade in spices was the probably largely unintended arrival in Britain of quantities of South Asian calicoes. These were of a markedly superior quality to anything which could be produced in Europe at the time; indeed, by comparison, the British had not by then developed any significant dyeing technology. South Asian calicoes in both silk and, later on, cotton became an increasingly desirable commodity in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, first as a luxury item but subsequen­tly as a widely used material. Britain had perhaps never faced such a large demand for a product which, since cotton could not be grown in the country, it was incapable of producing itself. 
Singapore<SEP>Tokyo: Investors catching European interest rate jitters drove the Nikkei average down 313.64 points to 35,209.35. Hong Kong: Receding concern about the situation in China was reflected in the market's continuing strength, the Hang Seng index posting its fourth successive gain at 2,826.21, up 23.04. <ENT>Singapore<ENT>: Shares closed firmer across the board in active trade, with the Straits Times index 8.17 points higher at 1,413.15. Sydney: Directionless trading brought little change, the All Ordinaries index ending just 0.7 ahead at 1,773.2 - but 37.4 points better on the week. 
UK<SEP>Interox to be split up Laporte of the <ENT>UK<ENT> and Solvay of Belgium are discussing a breakup of their Interox joint venture. The plan is for Solvay to take over the hydrogen peroxide and persalt business, with turnover of £340m pa, while Laporte takes the organic peroxides and persulphates, worth about £65m pa. 
Britain<SEP>The great majority of people do not live in traffic calmed layouts and would not be familiar with their design or purpose. There may be occasional discussion of calming principles in the literature and appraisals of such designs in practice, but the lasting impression provided by an examination of residential areas in Britain is the exceptionally slow pace of change by comparison with that on the Continent in general and Holland and West Germany in particular. A last distinction between calming experience in <ENT>Britain<ENT> after The Brow and that on the Continent since the Woonerf, lies in the dissimilar attitudes of government transport departments as reflected in their literature. The availability of detailed, comprehensive and up-to-date guidance on good practice is critical for local authorities that rarely feel able to take risks in design that might have long-term financial consequences. 
Thailand<SEP>A recent World Bank study of six East Asian countries concluded that Thailand was the only one that had failed to make significant inroads into poverty during the 1980s (see table). As the bank noted, ` in 1990 Thailand's incidence [ of poverty ] was as high as Indonesia's, even though its average GNP per capita was 2.5 times higher. " World Bank officials have no pat answers for why there has been so little trickle-down in <ENT>Thailand<ENT>. Some people think it is because the boom has concentrated on Bangkok. 
Germany<SEP>Sure, there is inefficient production, horrific pollution, shortages and corruption from East Berlin to the Soviet Union's Pacific coast. A lot can be blamed on years of dictatorship and rotten planning - but not all. The Soviet Union paid the highest price for the Allies' victory over Hitler's <ENT>Germany<ENT> in 1945. The Soviet dictator, Stalin, hadn't wanted to fight the Nazis, and panicked when they invaded in 1941. 
Britain<SEP>The influence of these publications in Britain is evident in the writings of, for example, Michael Ignatieff and some articles in the New Statesman (and Society). The focus of this work, as also of Adrian Oldfield's forthcoming Citizenship and Community, is an interest in the lessons which may be derived for modern society from the Classical-Renaissance-Enlightenment emphasis on civic virtue. Side-by-side with the political philosophers was the work of the sociologists, represented in <ENT>Britain<ENT> most eminently by Ralf Dahrendorf. This intellectual activity was partly no doubt prompted by the blatant individualism of the New Right. 
US<SEP>I am not sure if I ever took the idea of America very seriously. I think I must have realized that Jean-Claude had neither the nerve nor the genuine confidence to take up an appointment in a language he did not speak. Nevertheless, he went and discussed the details of the job with the cultural attaché at the <ENT>US<ENT> Embassy. There was more than one reason why I could not accompany Jean-Claude to America. 
Italy<SEP>After the Second World War this countryside witnessed the struggle between the priests and embryo commissars described in Guareschi's Don Camillo, a struggle which continued, in a more mild form, until comparatively recently. Parma became renowned for its elegance during the reign of Maria Luigia, Napoleon's second wife, daughter of the Emperor of Austria and mother of the King of Rome, when she was Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla; although it had already been famous under the Farnese and the Bourbons. It was Maria Luigia who commissioned the building of the Teatro Regio, with its white and gold and red plush interior, and appointed Paganini, who had lived in Parma since the age of twelve, to be one of the directors of her orchestra, at that time the finest in all <ENT>Italy<ENT>. I soon discovered that opera was a passion for the Parmigiani, who had extremely critical ears. 
Pakistan<SEP>To lose height pilots have to spiral down to the runway.

Britain<SEP>Life, after all, is funny. Soap, whether radio or TV, suggests a similar national contrast. Mrs Dale's Diary, which ran for twenty-one years on BBC radio from 1948, was always gently laced with humour; its rural rival, The Archers, which began two years later, is a broadly similar amalgam of the playful and the sentimental; and between them, in a sub-literary sort of way, they illustrate the power of a revived realism in post-war <ENT>Britain<ENT>: quite different from the grand-opera histrionics of American TV soaps like Dallas or Dynasty, which are scarcely funny at all, at least in intention, and wildly unrealistic as images of how the rich in the United States really live. British radio works far closer to the texture of ordinary life than that, engaging as it does a deeper sympathy for a shared world of ordinary experience and a total lack of awe. 
United Kingdom<SEP>With the possible exception of the Scottish National party. It will undoubtedly want to tell us why, in its new internationalism, it wishes to withdraw from NATO. On the assumption that most parties in the House wish to remain in NATO, why is it necessary for the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> to have a capability of this kind, in addition to the United States capability? If there is to be more defence co-operation in Europe, why is it necessary for Britain to have its own capability, in addition to that of France? 
Ecuador<SEP>Most of the soft drinks which children love are stored in aluminium cans, but like the steel ones, not nearly enough are re-cycled each year. Now you have a chance to save your aluminium cans - and help buy a rainforest in Ecuador! The Children's Tropical Forests Appeal has been set up to raise £10,000 to buy at least 285 acres of threatened tropical forest in the Jatun Sacha area of <ENT>Ecuador<ENT>. Each aluminium can you collect will buy one square metre of tropical forest which will be preserved for future generations. 
US<SEP>Friendly fire mother meets <ENT>US<ENT> Ambassador The US Ambassador to Britain has told a mother he won't send American pilots to the friendly fire inquest in Oxford. 
US<SEP>The argument about the thematic mapper data from Landsat-4 is, to some extent, academic. Hardware on board the craft transmitting data from the mapper has recently suffered a fault, leaving the low-resolution data the only kind available to ordinary ground stations. The US will, however, be able to pick up thematic-mapper information with a ground station at White Sands, New Mexico, to which data will be routed via the <ENT>US<ENT>'s new tracking and data relay satellites. The space shuttle launched the first of these last week (see below). 
Anguilla<SEP>Chief Minister: Oswald O. Skippings. ANGUILLA Following the report in early 1990 by accountants Coopers and Lybrand into the activities of offshore financial businesses in the UK's Caribbean dependent territories, it was agreed in talks in May between UK government officials and the Chief Minister, Emile Gumbs, that <ENT>Anguilla<ENT>'s Constitution would be amended (by Order in Council within the next few months) to allow the Governor to assume responsibility for the offshore financial sector. A review of offshore banks was also started and was expected to lead to several banks losing their licences to operate. 
Germany<SEP>The beef herd proved the breed's ability to thrive on modest feeding and to give high killing-out percentages in all age groups, and gradually the beef traits increased in importance until it became a single-purpose beef breed. The breed was already being exported to South Africa in the 1940s to improve the native cattle and it adapted well to a variety of climates and management systems. It has also been exported to Argentina, Uruguay, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, <ENT>Germany<ENT> and, in surprisingly large numbers, to Hungary, where in one herd alone there are 800 pure or graded-up polled Lincoln cows at Szentes, near the Romanian border. The Lincoln is the basis of the Hungarian Pankota Red and has also contributed to the American Fort Cross. 
India<SEP>Beds were provided in churches and halls, two meals a day were available for all of us. Slowly we made our way by steamer and train down to Calcutta, to join our families and wonder about the future. In <ENT>India<ENT> we missionaries were at a loose end. Military and government people were quickly absorbed into the war effort, but the churches were at a loss what to do with us. 
Kuwait<SEP>This group supported the formulation of a settlement within the Arab ranks and emphasized that the presence of foreign, and particularly US, troops in Saudi Arabia was a major obstacle to any solution of the crisis. Arab League meetings in Cairo - Adoption of resolution to commit Arab forces to Saudi Arabia The first attempt by the Arab states to formulate a unified response to the invasion came late on Aug. 3, over 40 hours after Iraqi troops first crossed into <ENT>Kuwait<ENT>. Some individual Arab states had already issued condemnations of the invasion. 
Nicobar Islands<SEP>Bernard was present at their interrogation by Australian and British officers and helped escort them to Singapore Supreme Court, where some were found guilty of war crimes. ` We were required to sit in court as a guard duty, " he says, ` and therefore listened to many of the charges brought against the accused, who were mostly senior Japanese officers, although some of the lesser ranks were involved. ` Most of the atrocities had been committed against the civilian population of Singapore and neighbouring areas like Sumatra, Java, Malaya and the <ENT>Nicobar Islands<ENT>. ` Those found guilty were returned to Changi Jail where they were put into condemned cells to await their fate of execution, mainly by hanging. 
Spain<SEP>ARTIST Ian Garland has drawn inspiration from the landscape of the Wirral peninsula for his latest exhibition, Home and Abroad with Garland. Paintings of Scotland and the Cantabrian country of northern <ENT>Spain<ENT> also form part of the collection at Dee Fine Arts, Telegraph Road, Heswall. Mr Garland, 38, of West Kirby, works full time as an artist, painting buildings and landscapes which capture textures of foliage, stone and sand. 
UK<SEP>New face takes over at Nivea SMITH & NEPHEW is to pick up £46.5m from selling the Nivea skin care brand back to Beiersdorf 50 years after it was confiscated from the German company during the Second World War. The deal only applies to Nivea products in the <ENT>UK<ENT>, the Commonwealth and South Africa. Beiersdorf already owns the brand elsewhere in the world.

North Korea<SEP>The aircraft carried some 100 passengers, most of whom were pro-North Korean residents of Japan and journalists invited by the airline. Death of Ho Dam Ho Dam, 62, one of <ENT>North Korea<ENT>'s most senior statesmen and, since 1983 a member of the politburo of the ruling Korean Workers' Party and Chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, died in Pyongyang on May 11 after a long illness. Ho had served as Foreign Minister between 1970 and 1983, during which time North Korea aggressively competed against South Korea for international recognition. 
Lebanon<SEP>The security forces had been sent to the bank to escort Naim to a meeting with Khazen to discuss the bank's refusal to advance money to pay for a contract to print 1,000,000 passports. Death of US missionary A Christian evangelist missionary from the United States, William Robinson, was shot dead by gunmen, claiming to be from the Lebanese Communist Party, in the southern <ENT>Lebanon<ENT> village of Rashaya Foukhar on March 27. Robinson ran a school for retarded Christian children and had clashed with local villagers, who accused him of setting up the first Israeli settlement in Lebanon. 
Britain<SEP>The sale of Vernons, generally viewed as a reflection of cash-flow difficulties at the time, can now be seen as yet another example of Sangster's far-sightedness, in part encouraged by expectations of a national lottery in Britain. Yesterday, Sangster said: ` It had to come and I'm delighted to hear that the government is committed to its introduction before long. ` When I was still involved with Vernons, we participated in the introduction of the lotteries in both New York and Sydney, and our experience then told me that football pools would be swept away should lotteries ever come to <ENT>Britain<ENT>. ` The experience in Australia was that the Lotto game, where six numbers out of 45 are drawn each week, reduced our football pools " take to 10 per cent of the previous figure. 
Norway<SEP>Video-Tape, no voice over Gordon Foxley from Henley on Thames was head of ammunition procurement at the MOD for five years. It's claimed that he was secretly paid commission for awarding work to three firms in Italy, Germany and <ENT>Norway<ENT>. He denies twelve counts of corruption, and the trial in London continues. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>Is the Leader of the House aware that the seventh report of the Public Accounts Committee on the privatisation of Harland and Wolff was not available to Members in the House until late yesterday evening and that it had been made available to others some time previously? That enabled the Belfast Telegraph, for example, to carry a huge article on the real cost of the sell-off. <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT> Members were disadvantaged because they did not have the information and could not comment. Will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that this sort of thing does not happen again? 
America<SEP>Coaching Visual Tennis Video-new release T John Yandell, one of <ENT>America<ENT>'s top coaches, has produced a new 60 minutes teaching video for beginners and those wishing to improve their games. It's called ` Visual Tennis " and offers the viewer a comprehensive approach to learning the game based on visualisation and mental imagery. 
Israel<SEP>As a result debt is described in the Pentateuch as a form of slavery. At the same time there was no organised capital market and so interest rates might be high. We do not know what interest rates were in <ENT>Israel<ENT> but we do know that the annual rate of interest in the ancient Near East was very high: in Babylonia and Assyria it was 20-25 per cent for money loans, 33 per cent for loans in kind and frequently more; in Upper Mesopotamia and Elam rates were higher, reaching 50 per cent for money loans; in the Ptolemaic period in Egypt rates seem to have been around 12 per cent. The prohibition of usury in the Old Testament, therefore, should not be taken as criticism of a modern competitive capital market. 
Pakistan<SEP>LARGEST AND LONGEST Rob Steen talks to <ENT>Pakistan<ENT>'s first great batsman, HANIF MOHAMMAD 
Austria<SEP>Johann was the jack of all trades on the farm. He had been hired out to them as someone who knew a little about farming, but when faced with the actual jobs proved to know nothing at all. In <ENT>Austria<ENT>, his native country, his trade had been woodcarving. He had carved figures which sold in the shops in Salzburg, but he had never set foot on a farm. 
Germany<SEP>As a result, by the time war was declared in 1939 MI6 had failed to establish any worthwhile network of agents in Europe and those it had were of very dubious quality, some even dishonest and fraudulent. MI6 never appreciated the amount of opposition that existed within Germany to Hitler and the Nazi party in its early days and as a result failed to exploit the very considerable amount of information that was offered to it by well-placed anti-Nazi groups. In 1939 MI6 received the famous Oslo Report, a package of technical information delivered to the British Legation in Oslo, containing a wealth of priceless data about secret weapon developments in <ENT>Germany<ENT> including rocket design at a then unheard of location called Peenemünde. Because MI6 possessed no one with any technical qualifications to analyse the Oslo Report it was rejected as worthless and ignored. 
US<SEP>Sally goes for roar power ACTRESS Sally Kirkland really earns her stripes as a tiger trainer for a TV Christmas special. The 48-year-old star of <ENT>US<ENT> soap Falcon Crest is also no pussycat with men. Former lovers include Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffman and she has dated Bob Dylan for years. 
Britain<SEP>Alongside the news this month of two new products from Trace Elliot (the Swell Pedal, their first-ever outboard accessory, and the TA-RP, a rackmount version of their hundred-watt Trace Acoustic amplifier) comes the announcement that Trace Elliot are now part of Kaman Music Corporation. As the largest music distributor in the USA, Kaman are already responsible for Takamine and Hamer guitars as well as Ovation, the original synthetic bowl-back guitar that Charles Kaman himself invented back in 1966 (some readers may have already spotted a close connection between Ovation and Trace Acoustic in ads featuring players like Adrian Legg and Robert Fripp). Fortunately, all the Trace management staff are staying on, and Kaman have a history of encouraging its subsidiary companies to retain their own product identities, so we at Guitarist sincerely hope that one of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s brighter amp companies will be allowed the freedom to continue with the experimental stuff. 
Great Britain<SEP>To him an important embassy was a perquisite of birth rather than the culmination of years of painstaking effort. The strength of these attitudes varied considerably between different countries. The aristocratic grip on the most important diplomatic appointments was weaker in <ENT>Great Britain<ENT>, and probably in Russia, than in France, Spain or the Habsburg territories. But everywhere it was still a factor inhibiting the growth of systematic training and the professionalism it symbolised. 
UK<SEP>An active drilling programme is planned in this area in order to maximise the use of the Caister facilities. To the east, the Markham field, operated by LASMO, came on stream during 1992. The field straddles the UK/Netherlands median line and is the first <ENT>UK<ENT> field to export gas to mainland Europe. Production commenced in November at a rate which quickly reached 130mmcfd. 
US<SEP>On 22 October 1980 Gabriel Ferrucci, president of Raybestos Manhattan's international division, flew into Cork to appear at a joint press conference with IDA at which the company announced its intention to pull out of Ireland. Mr Ferrucci denied that the continued dispute over the safety of asbestos had any part in the company's decision to close the factory, though he admitted that the environmental difficulties experienced were ` more severe " than Raybestos had expected, and no other Raybestos Manhattan factories were being closed down. Mr Ferrucci blamed the closure on the severe depression in the <ENT>US<ENT> market for brake disc pads. He also admitted that the initial delay in bringing the factory on stream had lost Raybestos Manhattan a market opportunity in Europe. 
Romania<SEP>Hewlett-Packard Hungary general manager Stojanov Rumen confirmed that the site would constitute the company's largest installation in the country. He also claimed it was the largest open system to be employed at a statistic office in Europe, and announced that the company planned to use it as a reference site for national accounting offices in both East and Western Europe. A project to computerise the national accounting system of <ENT>Romania<ENT> is currently under way, though Ruman expressed caution regarding his company's chances of winning that account. The announcement of the deal in the ballroom of the Statistics Office in Budapest was temporarily hijacked by the European Community's ambassador to Hungary, Hans Beck, who used the occasion to dish out European Community tie pins, lecture the local press on the absence of a ` Hungarian Way ", and launch a fierce attack on Hungary's decision to retaliate with tit-for-tat measures against an import ban on meat products introduced by the European Community two weeks ago following the discovery of foot and mouth disease in Italy. 
Britain<SEP>Hoko is his top target FRANK WIECHULA CLASSY Colin McMillan has Scouser Paul Hodkinson firmly in his slick-moving sights - determined to prove he's king of the featherweights in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. The WBO champion knows unless he takes on and beats WBC title-holder Hodkinson he can't be called boss in his own backyard, let alone the world. 
USA<SEP>Certainly no generalisation can be made except that the successful diffusion of the knowledge of soil conserving practices is often one essential change that is required - even although the knowledge may be possessed by some cultivators already. Usually, as this book will argue, successful agricultural extension is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for implanting sound conservation practices (see Thrupp (1981) for a case study of the (jaded) peasant view of conservation in Costa Rica). Solutions to population pressure, differentiation, and declining productivity through soil exhaustion and erosion, which lie outside the agricultural sector altogether, do not offer the same promise as they did in Japan, the <ENT>USA<ENT> or the United Kingdom during their industrial revolutions. Outmigration to cities in search of menial jobs or part-time work in nearby plantations provide remittances and reduce food demand, but these activities also reduce labour availability and have been responsible for the collapse of old-established terracing systems in the Middle and near East, particularly Yemen and also in the Andean part of Peru and Colombia. 
US<SEP>Roller-coaster ` The greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt America's resolve during this period of transition, " Clinton said in a statement outside the Arkansas governor's mansion in Little Rock, where he has lived for 12 of the last 14 years. He told <ENT>US<ENT> financial markets that have been on a roller-coaster in anticipation of his victory that although he had campaigned on a message of economic growth he understood the importance of stability. ` Today I say to our financial and business leaders that although change is on the horizon, we understand the need to pursue stability even as we pursue new growth. 
Zimbabwe<SEP>MPs celebrated noisily as the amendment to Section 16 of the (1980) Lancaster House Constitution was approved by 113 votes to three. Some analysts predicted that this heralded the most significant alteration in the structure of land ownership since the expropriation of black land by white settlers in the late 19th century. Since independence in 1980 some 52,000 peasant farmers had been resettled on 3,000,000 hectares purchased from the 4,000-strong white farming community, but whites still owned 12,000,000 hectares (40 per cent of <ENT>Zimbabwe<ENT>'s total land area). Some 750,000 black peasant farmers shared 15,000,000 hectares of largely poor quality " communal " land which was being placed under ever increasing pressure by Zimbabwe's 3.5 per cent annual population growth. 
Australia<SEP>Keating's predecessor as Prime Minister and Labor Party leader, Bob Hawke, promised to end woodchipping of old growth forests by 2000, a promise that Keating failed to endorse. Licences for woodchip exports from Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia were renewed on Dec. 31 [hellip] More than 70 per cent of <ENT>Australia<ENT>'s rain forests and half of its other forests have been destroyed. Because of Australia's preferential voting system, Green support was crucial to Labor's victory in the 1990 elections and will be again in the federal elections Keating has to call by June this year. 
West Germany<SEP>Cruas LICENSING difficulties may slow down the building of nuclear power plants in the United States, Britain and <ENT>West Germany<ENT> - but the French still press on almost untrammelled by objectors. France's highest legal body has finally dismissed an appeal against a light water reactor complex at Cruas on the river Rhone. 
Kenya<SEP>From one analysis of data for 25 developing countries, it was determined that, if all children were born at least two years apart, about one in five infant deaths would be averted. According to another report that was based upon essentially the same data, the spacing of second and higher order births at least two years apart would reduce infant mortality by 10 per cent and the death rate of children aged 1-4 years by 21 per cent. In traditional societies where prolonged breastfeeding has been the custom, the advantages of lengthy spacing are widely recognized though, as in <ENT>Kenya<ENT>, the tradition has begun to fade among some peoples along with the advance of modernization. Because the ability of breastfeeding to sustain the period of infecundity due to amenorrhoea over long periods depends, inter alia, upon the frequency and intensity of suckling, and in the light of the generalized view that lengthy spacing is essential to child survival, in most African and some other societies, breastfeeding is reinforced by abstinence. 
Pakistan<SEP>The gas sales agreement was finally agreed in principle with the transmission company after protracted negotiations, involving many of LOPL's finance and operations staff, supported by LASMO plc's manager of natural gas, Martin White, and Central Region's commercial and legal manager, Jeanne-Marie de Larrazabal. The critical aspect still to be agreed was the gas price. This was a mammoth task since the last deal in <ENT>Pakistan<ENT> - by another company - was based on a formula which resulted in a price that was half of what was required to make the project economically attractive. A team led by LOPL's general manager, Rupert Kidd, and consisting of Lewis Affleck and Martin White was set up to tackle the problem. 
France<SEP>The difference now is that the same factory supplies production to both sales forces and, in theory, our factories (Runcorn and Elderslie) have two chances to win the order instead of only one as in the past. Having said that, we have, of course, taken the opportunity to review our own sales operation in Europe. As you know, we have our own sales companies in <ENT>France<ENT> and Sweden, and we are determined to develop these further. In other European countries we have worked through agents and believe that it does not make sense for us to continue to try to service all those countries when LDP has a substantial full-time sales force already in place. 
North Korea<SEP>The report concluded that, until safer land-based storage systems had been devised, Russia would have no alternative but to continue the dumping of liquid radioactive waste at sea. *Greenpeace has revealed details of four incidents of dumping of radioactive waste by the Soviet navy in the Sea of Japan between 1985 and 1992, including the dumping of unprocessed liquid waste from a nuclear power station last year. The Russian navy is thought to have used one dump site, off <ENT>North Korea<ENT>, at least as recently as December 1992. Greenpeace's Joshua Handler says information from Russia is sometimes neither reliable nor forthcoming. 
Britain<SEP><ENT>Britain<ENT>'s recession became official. Government figures for October-December showed real gross domestic product had fallen, by 1%, for the second consecutive quarter - the conventional definition of recession. 
Kenya<SEP>Like Browne, he knew that the real locus of power in the tribe was the informal councils of elders, and he proposed that government sanction be given to their authority. But in his innocence - and Murrells was, administratively speaking, an innocent - he had forgotten that the first prerequisite of British control was to identify the men who would function as British agents, so that they could, in the event of unsatisfactory performance, be replaced. The Provincial Commissioner, Philip Mitchell, then near the beginning of the career which was to culminate in the governorships of Uganda and <ENT>Kenya<ENT>, complimented Murrells on his anthropological acumen - and advised him that the local councils of elders should ` consist where possible of one man, with three or more advisers, rather than a Committee because of the notorious weakness of Committees as executive instruments ". Mitchell then forwarded to Cameron in Dar es Salaam a quite unrecognizable version of the Murrells scheme which was nothing more than a vastly elaborated edition of the existing system of administration through the laibon and laigwenak. 
UK<SEP>The official Iranian news agency said that such statements not only effectively supported the Mojahedin's " terroristic " activities within Iran, but also their role in suppressing the Kurdish uprising in Iraq in early 1991. A third secretary at the UK embassy was reported on July 21 to have been given until the end of the month to leave the country, accused of having " violated diplomatic norms ". On July 24 the UK government ordered the expulsion from the <ENT>UK<ENT> of three Iranians accused of involvement in intelligence activity -two working without diplomatic status in the Iranian embassy, and the other a student -whose presence the Home Office said was " not conducive to the public good for reasons of national security ". It was suggested in the UK press that the expulsions were connected with the need to protect the writer Salman Rushdie [ see also p. 38984 ]. 
UK<SEP>Takeover activity and barriers to takeovers in the single market The level of takeover activity in the UK by both <ENT>UK<ENT> and other EC companies is unparalleled in the Community. By the same token, the level of takeover activity where UK companies acquire other EC companies is considerably less. 
United Kingdom<SEP>In any case as aforesaid the provisions of this Article shall take effect. (11) A Member shall before transferring any Share or holding any Share as nominee ensure that the intended transferee or beneficial owner submits to the Council a Compensation Fund covenant as required by the Rules and shall furnish evidence of such submission to the Directors. (12) Any notice required to be given under this Article by the Company to a Member or by a Member to the Company shall be given or served either personally or by sending it by first class post to the registered office of the Company or, as the case may be, to the registered address of the Member or (if he has no registered address within the United Kingdom) to the address, if any, within the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notice to him. When a notice is sent by post, service of the notice shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, prepaying and posting a letter containing the notice and to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post. 
France<SEP>A croissant warm from the oven, a cup of good coffee and a tumbler of just-squeezed orange juice costs under £1. An a la carte three-course supper for two with a bottle of very drinkable Moroccan red at, say, Le Petit Poucet comes to £10 all in. It's the sort of shabby restaurant you can still find in <ENT>France<ENT>: radishes and butter and spiced olives for nibbles, enormous roses plonked on the table and football on the TV in a back room are the setting for the very best pommes frites and memorable dishes of brains a beurre blanc and kidneys in garlic. Moroccan food turned out to be an equally good treat. 
United States<SEP>But in fact the problem was the position of Castro and of the communist regime in Cuba. The er Soviets claimed that, that these missiles were not offensive, and indeed the weren't offensive. The <ENT>United States<ENT> had the same sort of missiles in Italy and in Turkey and, before this crisis had developed, President Kennedy had in fact ordered them er to be er er returned to the United States, these missiles had no strategic purpose at all because a major change that had come into the strategic equation was the arrival of the intercontinental ballistic missile, and it was these missiles, really, which held the strategic balance er and were to change in fact radically both international politics and global strategy over the years to come, but I'm going to talk about that later, the point I'm making here is that er Khrushchev claimed that the missiles were there in the event of an American assault on Cuba, they were a deterrent weapon in exactly the same way as the defensive deterrent weapons er were d were defensive er for er the United States and for the Soviet Union. And the context in which this was er argued er was er the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, a C I A American supported invasion, er which er failed very badly but which certainly indicated the American desire to get rid of Castro and er Khrushchev was asserting in effect that he had as much right to defend an ally as the United States had er to defend erm its allies and in the same sort of way. 
the Argentine<SEP>The international network, at least for the Western imperial system, added a long ocean voyage between two rail journeys. Through the great Asian railways, Russia created a system that was entirely rail-borne. Commodities like fish, milk, and vegetables might be transferred locally; labourers - as in India and Southern Africa - regionally, together with grain, rice, coal, and perhaps some manufactured goods; while the great international transfers included human migrants, cotton from India, Egypt, the United States, and some parts of Africa and Latin America, tea from India and Ceylon, coffee from Latin America, wheat from Canada and the United States, gold from South Africa, silver from Mexico, copper from Central Africa and South America, cattle from <ENT>the Argentine<ENT> and the United States, lamb, wool, and dairy products from Australasia. In the other direction countless stations throughout the world were the distribution points for manufactured goods. 
South America<SEP>Filth and ugly matter poured from my body. A little square woman - to be identified when sanity returned as the doctor's wife came to change my bedding and cleanse me regularly. I sat up weakly one morning, and the ship's cabin had transmuted itself into a little square room in an isolated town in <ENT>South America<ENT>. Where had the illusion of the ship come from? 
France<SEP>In the main, building, particularly for churches, was in brick. This is true particularly of Greece, Italy, Egypt and southern Russia. Stone was, however, more common in southern <ENT>France<ENT>, Armenia, Georgia, Syria and on the Greek islands. In brick churches the whole construction was of this material, though interior wall facings, capitals and columns were of marble. 
America<SEP>` Whenever I have had some sort of public success, " he reported in his autobiography, ` it has inevitably been followed by a period of personal financial distress and prolonged unemployment. " Occasionally, British producers were able to secure foreign revenue to supplement the returns available to their films from the home market, but no one managed to secure a regular outlet for their productions in the US. Hepworth and Stoll failed in their attempt to set up a permanent sales operation in <ENT>America<ENT>; Samuelson secured a short-lived distribution arrangement with First National Exhibitors' Circuit, and various other films secured some sort of release. But the problem was that British exhibitors didn't produce a sufficiently reliable supply of quality product to ensure that any of these efforts were long-lasting. 
America<SEP>A heavy stream of important trading statements made little lasting impression on the shares involved. Cable and Wireless dipped 9p to 482p, the 22 per cent rise in interim profits. The renewed strength of gold and the sale of ARC of <ENT>America<ENT> and South African assets helped Hanson rise 5p to 221p. Stores were cautious in front of the Boots figures today. 
Kuwait<SEP>IRNA reported on Aug. 14 that Ahmad Khomeini, the son of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had described Saddam Hussein as " a modern-day Hitler " but added that " if the USA should wish to build up her troops in the region with the idea of dominating the region then our revolutionary troops will counter that device ". On Aug. 17 Ayatollah Moussavi-Ardebli told a Friday prayer meeting that " Saddam's occupation [ of Kuwait ] [hellip] can not be answered by another act of aggression ". On Aug. 21 the Speaker of the Iranian Majlis (parliament), Ayatollah Mehdi Karrubi, was reported to have told an open session of the Majlis that while Iran condemned the US military presence in the Gulf region, " we announce explicitly that Iraq's aggression against <ENT>Kuwait<ENT> is condemned ". 
Britain<SEP>In most countries, a service sector is inflationary. For instance, Japan's service sector is very inflationary, but Japan is able to keep down its general rate of inflation because its manufacturing sector is so large and efficient. That is not the case in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. Until last October, the RPI showed that the service sector component in terms of inflation was 9 per cent. 
Mozambique<SEP>One of these is the changing relationship of the former USSR and its separate parts on the one hand and the less developed countries (LDCs) on the other. Some of the major questions to be asked are: what changes are occurring in the economic relations with former client states - Cuba, Mongolia and Vietnam - and how far is this affecting the latters' future economic development? How much will these changes affect the future of other developing countries with Marxist or Soviet-orientated regimes, such as Ethiopia, Laos and <ENT>Mozambique<ENT>? What is the economic effect of these changes on countries such as India, Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria whose industrialisation, particularly in the field of heavy engineering, has been the main outcome of such Soviet co-operation? 
Saudi Arabia<SEP>This freedom of navigation is wider than innocent, or even transit, passage. It was an essential part of the peace settlement package but has a wider significance than just between the parties. The parties to a bilateral agreement can not impose these wider obligations on third parties, notably the other two Gulf States, <ENT>Saudi Arabia<ENT> and Jordan. The United States, itself a third party to the Peace Treaty, has guaranteed the treaty's implementation. 
Tunisia<SEP>MAGHREB STATES AMU summit Leaders of Algeria, <ENT>Tunisia<ENT>, Morocco, Libya and Mauritania, the member countries of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) formed in February 1989 [ see p. 36474 ], met in the Algerian capital, Algiers, on July 22-23. In a final communiqué they agreed to accelerate economic integration of their countries by the creation of a customs union by 1995, and called for the strengthening of economic ties with their main trading partner, the European Communities (EC). 
India<SEP>Discussion will continue at the summit of leading industrialised countries at Williamsburg, Virginia, in May. Under existing arrangements for weather satellites, the US, USSR, Japan and Western Europe operate weather craft that either hover above the Equator or pass over the poles. <ENT>India<ENT> will soon join the club. Data from the craft are swapped via a global telecommunications system coordinated by the World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva. 
France<SEP>The lack of spires is one of the chief differences between French and English cathedrals. The latter are smaller and lower and could bear the weight of a tall spire as at Salisbury (450). In <ENT>France<ENT>, a very tall but lightweight flèche was erected over the crossing. French cathedrals are often difficult to view as few have any open space around them. 
US<SEP>The caller demanded £40,000 for his story and was promised the cash when the voice was identified as that of Diana. It was identified but the caller never collected the money, leaving investigators with the belief that the mole had another, more sinister motivation. At the same time the National Enquirer, a gossip magazine in the <ENT>US<ENT>, received a transcript of the tapes. They published some details - and that's when the tapes in Britain were made public and the controversy erupted. 
Argentina<SEP>He carried into 1972 the kind of driving which had made his reputation in 1971, and if you study the fact-sheets for that year - the inaugural race at Paul Ricard in France is a good example - you will see Emerson well back on the grid and yet prevailing in the end to finish well enough. So it was that in 1972 the knowledge that consistency paid off, that concentration was necessary, that racing went to the prudent as well as to the bold began to pay off for Emerson. In <ENT>Argentina<ENT>, he was betrayed by his car, but after a bad fright in practice at Kyalami when a wheel came off, he came in second behind Denny Hulme after race-leader Jackie Stewart lost all the oil in his gear-box. By then, and with a couple of non-championship wins under his belt, Emerson and the whole Lotus team knew they were onto a winner in I972. 
America<SEP>Equally puzzling is Santander's promise not to take majority control of First Fidelity. That makes the investment look like little more than a punt on First Fidelity's shares - a profitable punt, perhaps, but a punt nonetheless. After a history of foreign misadventures, other European banks should think twice before they follow Banco de Santander into <ENT>America<ENT>'s treacherous banking market. 
Britain<SEP>PICTURE OF THE WEEK EVEN Gary Cooper in the classic film duel in High Noon would have been a'feared of gun-toting grannie June Greaves. How wonderful that at 62 she won <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s speed shooting championships. - 
Britain<SEP>It was soon followed by others. The pirate image was entirely fair. They broadcast on wavelengths allocated by international agreement and national laws to other services (in other countries, not just <ENT>Britain<ENT>), including maritime communications. They ` stole " the pop music that they broadcast by ignoring the law about royalties. 
Sri Lanka<SEP>It argues, in no uncertain terms, that levels of exploitation undreamed of outside the sweatshops of the Third World are coming home to roost in the depressed urban ghettos of the West. The ` beware " is aimed most urgently at women, the chosen workforce of the multinational corporations who have begun setting up shop in Western ` enterprise zones ". And the warning comes from other women - in countries like <ENT>Sri Lanka<ENT> and Malaysia - who have seen it all before in their own free-trade zones. The logic is coherent and chilling. 
Turkmenistan<SEP>Oil pipeline agreement with Iran President Saparmurad Niyazov visited Tehran, the Iranian capital, on Aug. 25 at the head of a large delegation, meeting President Hashemi Ali Akbar Rafsanjani. The two countries were later reported to have agreed to build a pipeline to deliver gas from <ENT>Turkmenistan<ENT> to Europe, via Turkey. Under a presidential decree of Aug. 6, oil and gas export prices were deregulated so as to bring them into line with world prices. 
Rhodesia<SEP>` That was your own fault, " interrupted Betty. ` You were so rude to them. When she said they'd just been to see their son in <ENT>Rhodesia<ENT> and you said ` Kenya for officers, Rhodesia for other ranks " it was awfully rude. " ` I should have said Zimbabwe, " said Lydia. 
US<SEP>But the significant point is that it underlines the United States' determination to prevent the persistent undervaluation of the mark or the yen. Such a concern is explained by the fact that these countries had repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to go to enormous lengths (in effect taxing imports of capital, encouraging exports of capital and, even in the case of Japan, organizing plans for importing huge stockpiles of raw materials) in order to prevent an upward movement of their currencies. If these countries felt they were being exploited by having to run a surplus and thus provide finance for the <ENT>US<ENT> deficit, such behaviour would be quite incomprehensible. On the contrary, their exporting sectors, extremely powerful in both countries, had a very strong interest in maintaining the exchange rate at a low level in order to generate the maximum possible export surplus. 
Germany<SEP>BRINGS ONE-STOP-SHOP CONCEPT TO UK WITH SAP's R/3 Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems Ltd is extending its ` one stop shop " fixed price hardware-software-services resource planning system, R/3 Live, to the UK. R/3 Live, which was first implemented in <ENT>Germany<ENT> last year, combines Siemens own hardware and services with the modular SAP R/3 system software from SAP AG of Walldorf, with which Siemens has a European agreement. According to the Gartner Group, the SAP R/3 system is destined to become the industry standard enterprise resource management system. 
UK<SEP>Nobody, including Da Silva and managing director Giovan Battista Razzeli, would say it would go into production, but ` we had the courage to build the SZ " was Da Silva's slightly encouraging line. If it's courage it takes to put sports cars and coupes into production then the product planners at Mazda deserve a medal. A year after the MX-5 arrived in the <ENT>UK<ENT>, Mazda had another niche car to present - the V6 engined but (unexpectedly) modestly powered MX-3. The MX-3, at 166ins long, is more a Volkswagen Corrado rival than the anticipated threat to the Honda CRX. 
United States<SEP>DID YOU KNOW? KING Peter II of Yugoslavia, who died in 1934, was the only European monarch ever to be buried in the <ENT>United States<ENT>. 
Israel<SEP>` Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased, " seems to be a deliberate combination of two famous Old Testament texts. ` Thou art my Son " comes from Psalm 2:7, where the king of Israel is addressed as ` Son " of God. The kings had been pretty poor specimens as ` sons ": they showed little enough of Yahweh's family likeness, and there was a long-standing hope in <ENT>Israel<ENT> that one day God would bring into the world a messianic Son, a worthy ruler to sit on David's throne. We know people were treasuring this hope at the time of Jesus, because in the caves of Qumran there has turned up a messianic anthology which includes the prophecy given to David in 2 Samuel 7:14. 
Britain<SEP>This short monograph reviews and summarises both current and past research on mature students in Higher Education. The period covered spans 1975-1986. Attention is focused on Scotland but evidence from the rest of <ENT>Britain<ENT> is also included. Mature Student was defined as someone who has been away from continuous education for more than one year. 
America<SEP>Suburban schools gleam with modern gadgetry, while inner-city schools lack basic text books. But a proposal to re-draw the tax-boundary line between them would win little favour in the rich suburbs. The slums in <ENT>America<ENT>'s great cities are shameful. They are a damning indictment of the richest country in the world. 
Saudi Arabia<SEP>A report in the Middle East International of Aug. 16 suggested that the publication of the Declaration before final agreement on its details had been prompted by Egypt's growing alienation from its Arab partners. A meeting of GCC, Egyptian and Syrian Foreign Ministers in July [ see p. 38364 ] had failed to reach a consensus on the terms of a regional defence pact, amidst reports of differences on the size and role of the new force, fears of Egyptian and Syrian domination, and continued Kuwaiti demands for additional Western military guarantees. In May Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak had announced the withdrawal of all Egyptian troops from Kuwait and <ENT>Saudi Arabia<ENT> [ see p. 38213 ], although he had subsequently offered to reconsider the decision [ see p. 38309 ]. In the preamble to the final version of the Declaration released by Egyptian officials, contracting parties reaffirmed their " rejection of the aggressive course and alignment that occurred during the Iraqi aggression and occupation of the state of Kuwait " and recognized that it had " destroyed many of the concepts and achievements of joint Arab action ". 
Pakistan<SEP>More than 1,800 people, mostly women and children, were killed and a further 1,500 wounded during August in the heaviest fighting between mujaheddin factions since the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibullah regime in April [ see pp. 38847; 38915 ]. The forces of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hezb-i-Islami fundamentalist group opposed to the interim government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, launched on Aug. 10 a continuous bombardment of Kabul, the capital, with rockets, shells and cluster bombs, and followed up with ground attacks, supported by tanks, on Aug. 19. On Aug. 16 Rabbani, who was forced to postpone foreign visits to Iran and <ENT>Pakistan<ENT> due to the crisis, dismissed Prime Minister Abdul Sabur Fareed as the most senior Hezb-i-Islami member in the government and Hekmatyar's personal nominee for the post. Deputy Defence Minister Gen. Abdul Hakim, also of Hezb-i-Islami, was also forced to step down. 
France<SEP>Commercially, it's a pain in the arse. " But the RYA was always more likely to plump for a more conventional design and building set-up, and four boats at Rutland Water looked to be in the frame. The Marc Laurent-designed Equipe had the advantage of existing in numbers in <ENT>France<ENT> and Italy. Against that, the competition at Rutland Water thought it typically French: too stable and underpowered. 
Ireland<SEP>In addition - and this is a concession which the British Government refuses to grant - tax relief is available against the costs of repairing and maintaining historic houses. There are one or two magnificent examples coming on to the market. Few of <ENT>Ireland<ENT>'s great Ascendancy houses, perhaps no more than 50, remain in private family occupation: one of the most significant, Stackallan, in County Meath, is a rare early-18th-century, pre-Palladian pile in the Boyne valley between Navan and Slane, which will be offered for sale later this month. Most neo-Classical houses in Ireland date from 1730 onwards; Stackallan, however, was built around 1714 for Gustavus Hamilton, one of William III's generals, who raised six regiments for the King, including the Inniskillings, and was made Viscount Boyne by George I. 
Vietnam<SEP>Its leaders were often student radicals, members of groups like the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society); but the wave of protest took in many young people who would not normally have got involved in politics. Johnson dismissed the student protesters with their chant of " Hey, hey, hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today? " as " long-haired peaceniks ", who enjoyed the security that was guaranteed by American servicemen in areas like <ENT>Vietnam<ENT>. He claimed that the most " ordinary " Americans supported his Vietnam policy. 
Germany<SEP>Mhm. Mhm. I know they make wreaths just like you're meaning in <ENT>Germany<ENT> f at Easter. Aha. 
Bahama Islands<SEP>An attempt was then made to pursue an onward appeal to the Court of Appeal. Amongst the points in issue was the question whether, if the appeal was validly brought, the court had jurisdiction to make an order for costs. On a further appeal to the Privy Council the Board held that, if jurisdiction existed at all, it must have been under a section of the relevant Bahamas legislation (section 23 of the Court of Appeal Act (Statute Law of the <ENT>Bahama Islands<ENT>, 1965 rev., c. 34)) which provided: ` No costs shall be allowed by the court on either side in connection with the hearing and determination of an appeal in any criminal cause or matter [hellip] 
Afghanistan<SEP><ENT>Afghanistan<ENT> The battle for 
Hungary<SEP>Assuming that it is ratified, what is its relevance in the search for a solution to the problem of the enlargement of the EC? Before the Danish ` No " vote and the narrow French ` Yes " vote, there was broad understanding that, barring upsets, Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland could, if they so wished, become full EC members in 1995. Poland, <ENT>Hungary<ENT> and Czechoslovakia (or the Czech and Slovak republics) might then accede in 2000 or soon thereafter. The Danish and French votes and the financial crisis of September 1992 will probably cause this timetable to be delayed by something like two years; they have also cast doubt as to the continuing will of all the applicant states to become full EC members. 
Britain<SEP>As you approach the Peak District National Park from the west across the monotonous Cheshire Plain, past the star­probing Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope, a small blimp on the horizon gradually takes on the classic, pyramidal mountain shape - a sort of mini Mount Fuji. The peak is Shutlingsloe, which rises above Macclesfield Forest, and its textbook shape when viewed from most directions belies its modest height of just 506 metres. Shutlingsloe is just one of the numerous miniature mountain gems in <ENT>Britain<ENT> where quality, not quantity is the main attraction. It isn't their height but their shapely form that attracts discerning hillgoers, and since many of the tops are not included in tick lists - some of the Scottish ones don't even get Corbett status - they tend not to be as popular as their loftier neighbours. 
Spain<SEP>Under the Treaty's Title II Article 8b, citizens of other EC countries would be able to vote in municipal elections, and to be elected to municipal councils. However, derogations specific to Luxembourg would limit their number to 25 per cent of any council, prevent their election to a mayoral post, and set eligibility requirements of a minimum 10-year residency in Luxembourg and ability to speak Letzeburgish. In <ENT>Spain<ENT> the Congress of Deputies (lower house of parliament) on July 22 and the Senate (upper house) on July 30 approved a constitutional change to allow ratification. The amendment -the first since the Constitution was adopted in 1978 -would allow EC citizens to stand in municipal elections. 
North America<SEP>He has a few sharp words to say about smoking on page 18 - definitely NOT an ingredient of a healthy lifestyle in his professional book. It's a similarly dual picture on the business front. For Minerals it's a time to press ahead, free of the bad weather handicaps which, in <ENT>North America<ENT> particularly, have dogged production longer than usual this year. Construction tends to plough on regardless of the weather, but the long hours of daylight are a big plus and sunshine is a decided improvement over icy winds. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>Intellectually, the problem is the British presence in Ireland. But emotionally, the non-people are hated or at least detested. Clare O'Halloran (1986) has shown how the social reality of <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT> remained a continuing blind spot for Southern Irish nationalists particularly from the founding of the state to 1949. We aim to show in Chapter 5 that this blindness was in part promoted by the religious elements in their beliefs. 
Israel<SEP>A United States congressional panel of Democratic members of the House of Representatives chaired by John. J. Moakley, which was investigating the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador [ see pp. 37037-38; 37181; 37957 ], concluded in an internal memorandum on Nov. 18 that senior members of the military high command had " very possibly " ordered the murders. The panel noted " direct and circumstantial evidence " that Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, then Commander of the Air Force (now military attaché in <ENT>Israel<ENT>), Gen. René Emilio Ponce, then the Army Chief of Staff (currently Defence and Public Security Minister), and Gen. Juan Orlando Zepeda, currently the Deputy Defence Minister, had been among those who had planned an attack the day before at the Salvadorean military academy. Two lower-ranking officers were convicted of the murders on Sept. 28, 1991, while seven were acquitted [ see p. 38414 ]. 
America<SEP>Passengers must also be selected at random and be subjected to a complete baggage check. All checked-in baggage must be " matched " to a passenger travelling on the aircraft. Citing security, airline and FAA officials won't say exactly what is required of carriers flying from <ENT>America<ENT>. It is known, however, that baggage in the hold must be " matched " to a passenger on board and that some, but not all, of the luggage bound for the hold is x-rayed. 
France<SEP>BALLYCLARE golfer Stephen Hamill is in joint 11th place going into the final round of the £53,000 Divonne Open in <ENT>France<ENT>. Hamill, who has dropped back to 34th place in the Challenge Tour order of merit following his recent two-week break, had a three-under par 68 in the third round to leave him with a tournament aggregate of 210, seven shots behind leader Frederick Larsson of Sweden. 
Afghanistan<SEP>By Dec. 28 the pro-government Tajik People's Front had taken control of the border Pyanj region, reported to be a rebel stronghold. Plight of refugees More than 100,000 refugees from the fighting were reportedly stranded on the banks of the Oxus river, between Tajikistan and <ENT>Afghanistan<ENT>; relief agencies said that people were dying of cold in the freezing conditions. Some 5,000 people a day were entering Afghanistan in mid-December, braving an icy river crossing. 
Kuwait<SEP>In what does it consist? First of all Kuwait as a country goes back to seventeen fifty. It has always been known as Kuwait, and erm the settlers of <ENT>Kuwait<ENT> are Arabs that came from Saudi Arabia and the southern part of Iraq and the southern parts of Iran, and they are settlers there. They are merchants and in their life before the oil they were very well known merchants and they had tribesmen in that area. 
Jamaica<SEP>Jamaicans usually claim to be able to understand everything said in Standard English; it comes as something of a shock to many of them to find that English people can by no means always understand them. (J.C. Wells, 1973: 3) This was certainly the case with Mrs S., the mother of one of my teenage informants, born in rural <ENT>Jamaica<ENT> about 1930, who moved to London about 1960: I've never work - I've never really work when I was back in de West Indies my husband work, I worked when I came over here and I [ took a long time ] to get a job - because I could remember work at de Post Office and I when I pronounce my words you know too [ soft ] dey say dey don't hunderstand - according to dem dey don't hunderstand me, my haccent maybe it's my haccent or what dey don " understan " it or ting an " I feel like I'm speakin " the same English like over here. Mrs S., though her speech shows some grammatical influences from Creole and a strong Jamaican accent, certainly was not speaking Jamaican Creole on this occasion. 
France<SEP>Still, it is sometimes possible to infer alterations over time, and one direct conclusion that can be drawn is that part, at least, of landlords' rationale was economic: within a situation affected by such non-economic factors as pious donations, landlords organised estates and renders to maximise resources. This was a function of the domanial estate-structure (sometimes known to English-speaking historians as the manorial system), that is of a central directly-farmed agricultural unit, having peasant-tenements grouped around it and owing labour-services on it, and more distant tenements associated with it owing other types of dues and services. This domanial regime suited large-scale landlords with far-flung holdings (great monasteries were landlords of this type), and by Charles the Bald's reign, it had become general in much of what is now <ENT>France<ENT> north of the Loire with some examples also further south in Poitou. The combination of labour-services, other services, and renders in cash and kind needed careful management. 
Bahamas<SEP>They feared 12ft tidal waves would lash the Atlantic coast from West Palm Beach to Miami and the Florida Keys. The Association of British Travel Agents said its members were moving hundreds of British tourists to safety in Orlando. A spokesman said Thomsons had flown 114 people out of the <ENT>Bahamas<ENT>. ` Others are being moved by coach and plane from Miami to safer areas in north Florida. " 
Italy<SEP><ENT>Italy<ENT> 
France<SEP>If, as happened very occasionally - for instance in the great boom of 1872-3 - some workers actually earned enough to afford for a brief moment the luxuries which employers regarded as their right, indignation was sincere and heartfelt. What business had coal-miners with grand pianos and champagne? In countries of labour shortage, undeveloped social hierarchy and a truculent and democratic working population, things might be different; but in Britain and Germany, <ENT>France<ENT> and the Habsburg Empire, unlike Australia or the United States, the suitable maximum for the labouring class was a sufficiency of good decent food (preferably with less than a sufficiency of strong drink), a modestly crowded dwelling, and clothing adequate to protect morals, health and comfort without risking improper emulation of the costume of their betters. It was to be hoped that capitalist progress would eventually bring the labourers nearer to this maximum, and regrettable (though not inconvenient for keeping wages down) that so many were still so far below it. 
France<SEP>The opportunity is self-evident. Moments of structural crisis in a nation state are harbingers of revolution and inevitably give rise to the necessary social and political climate for the production of revolutionary literature. The problem is less obvious but deep-rooted, and can perhaps be most clearly formulated in the following question: Given the turbulent and unstable historical context of post-1914 <ENT>France<ENT>, is it possible to produce novels which are technically and artistically successful, politically effective, and accurately reflect contemporary social reality? Nizan himself expressed it more simply: " The major problems consist in infusing art with the spirit of revolution without destroying art in the process. " 
Italy<SEP>More foreign gods were admitted into the Greek pantheon than at any time since prehistory. In their turn the barbarians not only accepted Greek gods, but assimilated many of their own gods to Greek gods. It was an unsystematic syncretism which was particularly successful in <ENT>Italy<ENT> (Etruria and Rome), left its mark on Garthage, Syria and Egypt, was unsuccessful in Judaea, rather insignificant in Mesopotamla, and affected at least the iconography, if not the substance, of Indian religion through Gandhara art. The notion of a barbaric wisdom gained consistency and acceptance among those who considered themselves Greeks. 
Netherlands<SEP>Britain now opposed a European Community bloc which included West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, backing controls on motor exhausts and FGD for power stations. The ` victims " of acid rain had also begun to form an alliance - the ` 30 per cent Club ", a group committed to reducing 1980 sulphur emissions 30 per cent by 1993. It included Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, West Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT> and Canada. 
Spain<SEP>THE Euro-summit deal will cost Britain £200 million a year - around £10 for every taxpayer. That is the amount conceded by John Major to the EC budget, swelling the Brussels coffers managed by Commission President Jacques Delors to £64.4 billion a year by 1999. The four poorest EC countries - <ENT>Spain<ENT>, Portugal, Greece and Ireland - will share £2.5 billion extra a year in EC grants. The largest share of the money - known as cohesion cash - will go to Spain, which will take £1.25 billion. 
Republic of Somalia<SEP>The former government of President Siad Barre has ceased to exist and she has received no accreditation or authority from any other government. It is not clear that she currently has any diplomatic status, though there is some evidence that the United Nations may still for some purposes recognise her ambassadorship. But it is clear that she has no diplomatic status in the United Kingdom and has no recognition from Her Majesty's Government as a representative of the <ENT>Republic of Somalia<ENT> in this country. Accordingly, I refuse her application to be joined as a party to this action. 
Britain<SEP>I DO not think Nicholson was right to bring Natasha to <ENT>Britain<ENT>. he was merely pandering to his feelings did nothing for the children he left behind. 
China<SEP>Pro-democracy demonstrations Ten newly elected legislative councillors of the liberal United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) led a procession of 1,300 people on Sept. 29 calling for the release of political prisoners in China and commemorating the 1989 crackdown in Beijing on pro-democracy demonstrators. Seven of the councillors attended a nighttime vigil on Oct. 1, opposite the New China News Agency (NCNA) building, <ENT>China<ENT>'s de facto embassy in Hong Kong. 
Singapore Strait<SEP>Would that the other coasts were so simple! To perform the same task on the other side of the world, the following eleven major seas - all on the continental side of the Andesite Line, all secure on their own tectonic plates - need to be included (we are proceeding northwards and clockwise, from a point somewhere south of New Zealand): the Tasman, Solomon, Coral, Bismarck, Philippine, South China, East China and Yellow Seas, the Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. There are lesser seas which must also be included, in particular the fifteen around the islands of the East Indian archipelago: the Sulu, Celebes and Molucca Seas, the Gulf of Tomini, the Halmahera, Ceram, Banda, Arafura (which may or may not contain the Gulf of Carpentaria, depending on which atlas is used), Timor and Flores Seas, the Gulf of Boni, the Bali Sea, the Makassar Strait, the Java and Savu Seas; and there is the Gulf of Thailand, the Strait of Malacca, the <ENT>Singapore Strait<ENT> and the Inland Sea of Japan. Add to this the Great Australian Bight and the Bass Strait - for if we did not, it would be difficult to regard Australia as a Pacific nation, which would indeed be a foolish error - and we have arrived at what seems the most appropriate and comprehensive definition of our goal: one oceanic bloc, twenty-four marginal Seas (of which one is designated Inland), five Gulfs, four Straits, one Canadian Confusion and one Australian Bight. 
UK<SEP>The income would be taxable under Case IV or V of Schedule D on the UK beneficiary. It is not possible to argue that Part XV of the Taxes Act 1988 deems that interest to belong to the American. This is because it is a non-UK source income which would be deemed, if the provision was relevant, to belong to a non-resident person and no <ENT>UK<ENT> tax would be in point. Example 
Zambia<SEP>The Zambians have chosen their President and their Government. President Chiluba has our best wishes to help him get on with the job; we shall do our best to assist him, because the election was a fine example of the principles that we endorsed at the recent Heads of Government meeting in Harare. We hope that there will soon be great progress in <ENT>Zambia<ENT>. 
Philippines<SEP>It provided for the unimpeded movement of foreign exchange and gold into and out of the country by both Philippine residents and overseas investors, and removed the requirement that foreign exchange earned abroad by Philippine-based commodity and service exporters be sold to Manila-based banks. Issues relating to Imelda Marcos The decision to remove exchange controls had an unexpected bearing on the progress of the campaign against Imelda Marcos, whom the government was prosecuting on corruption charges relating to the years in which her late husband had been President of the <ENT>Philippines<ENT>. On Aug. 13 it was reported that a Manila judge had dismissed 11 of the 39 charges against Marcos on the grounds that the government's de-regulation of foreign exchange dealings had removed the court's authority to hear charges relating to currency violations arising from the overseas bank accounts held by Marcos. 
United Kingdom<SEP>Regional Government (England) Ms. Joyce Quin (Gateshead, East) I wish to call attention to the need for regional government in England, and I beg to move, " That this House deplores the excessive centralisation of government in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> since 1979 and the failure to decentralise and devolve power to the nations and regions of the United Kingdom; notes that this is in direct contrast to the general trend towards decentralisation evidence elsewhere in Europe; furthermore deplores the severe cuts in the regional assistance budget since 1979 together with the failure to enact dynamic and effective regional economic policies which would have promoted balanced economic growth and prosperity; expresses alarm at the regional divisions which continue to characterise the United Kingdom economy; and considers that the creation of a regional tier of government in the English regions as well as national devolution to Scotland and Wales is now vital to the United Kingdom's future economic and political well-being. I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this subject which has interested me for a long time. 
Honduras<SEP>Major international affiliations: ALADI (observer) Geplaces; OAS; San José Group; SELA. POLITICAL SYSTEM <ENT>Honduras<ENT> gained its independence from Spain in 1821.

Hong Kong<SEP>Hugo Gurdon, our South-East Asia Correspondent, sets out the perks and pitfalls of a post that has only one certain outcome - it will end at midnight on June 30, 1997 By HUGO GURDON NOT the least onerous of the <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT> Governor's duties is to wear a big fore-and-aft hat billowing with goose feathers. Ceremonial plumage makes it difficult to tell whether the hat fits. 
France<SEP>In fact, one of the most fascinating chapters deals with the history of Mulhouse and the meeting between science and industry in the region of shifting political allegiance far from the centralist powers in Paris. But all is not politics and institutions. As said, ` The history of science is science itself " and, appropriately, Fox uses the history of the study of heat in eighteenth and nineteenth century <ENT>France<ENT> to demonstrate the changing aspirations and preoccupations of the participating scientists. there is's ` particles of fire " theory of heat set in the context of the arguments that raged at the time: that is, heat as a fluid (caloric) versus heat as motion (kinetic). and appear with their study of specific heats, the results of which dealt a severe blow to the Laplacian school that supported the caloric theory. 
America<SEP>At this period in time Highlander had also been working on a community health program, the broad aim of which was; ` to help educate local residents who had suddenly found themselves members of a community health clinic board. The origin of such clinics was the inheritance of health care sometimes with a facility, sometimes without - from the health care program of the United Mine Workers (of <ENT>America<ENT>), a program that had fallen victim to contract negotiations. " By this stage however the program had moved beyond the provision of primary health care and was attempting to address the broader issues on environmental health and safety in Appalachia in response to the realisation of a growing problem. 
France<SEP>The sculpture on the portals and the interior is magnificent, very French in treatment but German in expression; the wise and foolish virgins, for example. Damage to the sculptures during the Revolution was considerable, but the restoration has been excellently done (PLATE 62). Beauvais Cathedral in northern <ENT>France<ENT> was an ambitious project of the High Gothic period. Begun in 1247, it was designed on a tremendous scale. 
Madagascar<SEP>Sr Pierre-Elise Gafah is the first woman to head the Secretariat of CEPACS, the Communication Commission of the Catholic Bishops' Conferences of Africa and <ENT>Madagascar<ENT>. As Executive Secretary she is responsible for the overall communication planning of the Roman Catholic Church in Africa. 
United States<SEP>The razzmatazz of a US election can be an education for anyone not fully versed in politics the American way, but just how does the rather involved system work? The major difference between the American and British systems is that we vote for an MP, the party with the most MPs wins and its leader moves into Number Ten. In the <ENT>United States<ENT> the vote for the President is cast separately to those for members of The House of Representatives (lower house) and The Senate (upper house). And the presidential election is not won on a first-past-the-post basis by simply tallying the votes for Bush, Clinton and Ross Perot across the country. 
Britain<SEP>One of these was the making of jewellery. After some years the designs from the Empire influenced fashionable people in their taste, and Roman style bronze brooches and bangles, some of them made in Britain, were worn by the men and women of prosperous families. Bronze, an alloy of mainly copper and tin, could be polished until it looked almost like gold, and the technique of making it had been known in <ENT>Britain<ENT> for centuries. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>The reports, whilst vindicating certain activities, stated that solicitors were overpaid for conveyancing, which yielded over 50 per cent of their income. In 1967 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission reported on the supply of solicitors' (and also barristers') services in relation to restrictions on advertising. The ultimate embarrassment came in 1976 when the prime Minister announced the establishment of a Royal Commission to make a general inquiry into the law and practice relating to the provision of legal services in England, Wales and <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT>. The Commission considered changes desirable in the public interest in the structure, organisation, training, regulation of and entry into the legal profession, although the final report has been seen largely as a vindication of the profession. 
Kuwait<SEP>Responding to the charge that the restrictions attached to oil sales violated Iraqi sovereignty, the United States permanent representative at the UN, Thomas Pickering, said that they had been included to " prevent [ food and medicines being diverted ] to the Iraqi privileged classes as has happened in the past ". On Aug. 1 the Iraqi Minister of Trade, Mohammad Mehdi Saleh, had denied reports that food and medical supplies were diverted to the armed forces and members of the Ba'ath Party. On Aug. 15 the UN World Food Programme (WFP) began distributing 90,000 tonnes of food in Baghdad amidst reports that the governing body of the UN Compensation Fund [ see p. 38211 ] intended to order Iraq to pay compensation to workers forced to leave <ENT>Kuwait<ENT> and Iraq as a result of the Gulf crisis.

Bulgaria<SEP>(On July 30 Zhivkov issued a statement declining to address the Assembly.) Cremation of Georgi Dimitrov The embalmed corpse of Georgi Dimitrov, <ENT>Bulgaria<ENT>'s Communist leader from 1946 until his death in 1949, was removed on July 18 from the mausoleum in central Sofia where it had been on public display, and was cremated in a private ceremony. Over 200,000 people took part in a memorial march for Dimitrov through Sofia on July 23. 
Norway<SEP>The one of the Dallachy Strike Wing (FP November, p29) has been less publicised than its counterpart at Banff to the south, perhaps because it operated the Beaufighter rather than the more glamorous Mosquito. The other was dedicated at the long abandoned RAF Skitten, near Wick, to the men lost on Operation Freshman. This was an attempt to sabotage a heavy water plant in <ENT>Norway<ENT> vital to German atomic bomb development. The writer takes modest satisfaction that his comments in Action Stations 7, the Scottish airfields volume, about the lack of a memorial struck a chord with a survivor of Freshman. 
US<SEP>I admit to feeling a little dubious regarding the adequacy of these small filtration units and this was well-founded in some respects as I discovered that although the two models are described as 35 and 55 gallon capacity no mention is made in the advertising that this refers to US gallons not Imperial. This means that each of these filters only has a capacity of 80% of the size stated, in imperial gallon terms. I decided in the circumstances that the 35 US gallon model was hardly adequate for my purposes and traded up to the 55 <ENT>US<ENT> gallon model. The general concept of the Biolife filter is good and there are some pretty advanced design features for such a relatively modestly priced filtration unit. 
Ireland<SEP>the English working class [hellip] can never do anything decisive here in England until it separates its policy with regard to Ireland in the most definite way from the policy of the ruling class, until it not only makes common cause with the Irish, but actually takes the initiative in dissolving the Union established in 1801, and replacing it by a federal relationship. And, indeed, this must be done, not as a matter of sympathy with Ireland, but as a demand made in the interest of the English proletariat. Or again: It is in the direct and absolute interest of the English working class to get rid of their present connection with <ENT>Ireland<ENT> [hellip] For a long time, I believed that it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by English working class ascendancy [hellip] 
British India<SEP>In Gloucester in 1831 all three candidates adopted an antislavery stance as a result of being questioned, one going so far as to have ` cards in his constituent hats with ` No Slavery " printed up on them ". In the post-Reform Act election of December 1832 abolitionists published pledges from over 160 candidates; 132 pledged MPs were elected. This was the most successful moment of the pledge technique, though it was employed in the 1837 election to end apprenticeship and suggested in 1841 by the BFASS to create a parliamentary bloc ready to abolish slavery in <ENT>British India<ENT>. But in 1837 there is evidence of broader intervention in the election. 
United States<SEP>The list is long and varied and what you choose or the combinations you try will depend on what you want your event to achieve.

NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST The National Prayer Breakfast in the <ENT>United States<ENT> is an annual gathering of political and religious leaders and other key national figures who meet to pray for the nation. This was the programme for the 1989 meeting. 
Singapore<SEP>Singapore Before you invest in a country, ask how much the country has invested in itself. <ENT>Singapore<ENT> is one of the few countries that supports the reality of global business. For instance, Singapore Telecom operates Asia's first international digital telephone exchange with the world's highest density of optical fibre networks. 
New Zealand<SEP>Northampton's return to challenging for top honours was brought about by a complete overhaul of the club's structure both on and off the field. From that moment they have gone from strength to strength and last year reached the final of the Pilkington Cup only to lose in extra time. In another inspired move this season they have added a new coach in Glen Ross, from <ENT>New Zealand<ENT>. Having coached Waikato in the New Zealand provincial championship for some years, Ross was looking for a new challenge and the opportunity to come to Northampton came at exactly the right moment. 
Zambia<SEP>Within each region, there are: Countries where educational difficulties over the last decade have been caused mainly by economic problems related to the burden of debt service and the effects of stabilization and adjustment policies designed to cope with them. The cases to be discussed here are <ENT>Zambia<ENT>, Zimbabwe and Costa Rica. Countries where existing economic problems affecting education have been compounded by war and insurgency. 
Britain<SEP>WHITE COLOUR-POINTED CATTLE In <ENT>Britain<ENT> the dark extreme of the colour-sided cline described in the Genetics section is characteristic of the Gloucester, while the light (colour-pointed) extreme is the standard colouring of two breeds: the horned White Park (including the Chillingham) and the polled British White. Other breeds have colour-pointed varieties such as the White Galloway and White Welsh, but these are colour varieties within their breeds rather than separate breeds and quite often their non-standard colour can be traced back to crossings with White Park or British White in the past. 
UK<SEP>Mercifully the issue of censorship in the UK is not at present the matter of life and death that it can be in other countries, yet various instances of censorship in recent years (even in the library field) have illustrated how inflammatory the question of censorship can be. Fortunately the considerable degree of freedom of speech and expression that we enjoy allows us to discuss and challenge censorship at all levels and at all times. It is a privilege enjoyed by everyone in this country but because the library profession has a responsibility for some considerable part of the provision of and access to literature and information, there is a heightened obligation for the library profession in the <ENT>UK<ENT> to resist censorship with a much greater collective and individual will than it has tended to show in the past. Much of the Press coverage of library censorship tends to be concerned with attempts to censor so-called obscene and indecent literature. 
MALI<SEP>AFRICA <ENT>MALI<ENT> Mali election results 
France<SEP>By contrast, 1 per cent of Channel 4 programmes contained violence, with an average frequency of one violent act per hour. The figures for BBC 1 and BBC 2 were 10 per cent, with violent acts occurring at a rate of 2.5 per hour on BBC 1, and two on BBC 2. Although he found that television is far less violent than in Japan, the United States, <ENT>France<ENT> or West Germany, Dr Tadecki intends to campaign with Mary Whitehouse to curb violence on the screen. Dr Tadecki said: ` Research in America indicates that someone is up to 50 per cent more likely to lose their temper if they regularly watch violent television programmes such as The Equalizer. " 
Germany<SEP>Hear! Preferably by retaining the two-thirds majority, but at least ensuring as my Noble Friend Lord has suggested, a clear majority and I myself will go on reiterating the principle, enunciated by Professor in the er and also much commended by some elements in the Conservative Party and he said you can not have real effective democracy without real effective local self government, and he said that in the light of his experiences in pre-war Germany. If I might repeat again what I suggested in the debate on the White Paper er there is a comparison perhaps pushed a little far w which what the national socialist did in <ENT>Germany<ENT> by saying a locally elected major-like does not represent the wishes er an er interests of the people of Cologne, as well as perhaps an appointed business man with the name of Krupp. Now that may be pushing it too far, but there are real dangers in giving a Home Secretary of any power, er the powers that this bill, bill suggests. 
Thailand<SEP>Conditions in Jordan's desert camps worsened dramatically this week as internation aid agencies launched their biggest relief effort since the Ethiopia famine of nineteen eighty-four. More than one hundred thousand refugees from occupied Kuwait and Iraq are stranded in makeshift camps, where there's a desperate shortage of food, water and medicine. The majority of them are from <ENT>Thailand<ENT>, the Philippines and the Indian sub-continent. Crown Prince Hassan of Jordon said his country was facing a severe economic crisis. 
Germany<SEP>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, in an important policy shift, were meanwhile considering loosening citizenship laws to integrate several million Turks and other foreigners into German society. Two CDU politicians, in comments seen as trial balloons for a longer debate, argued at the weekend that Bonn's laws should allow dual citizenship to extend full rights to foreigners living in Germany for decades. Opposition Social Democrats and Mr Kohl's liberal coalition partners, reacting to the neo-Nazi murder of three Turks last November, have renewed longer-standing calls to naturalise some of the six million foreigners working in <ENT>Germany<ENT>. A grass-roots initiative supported by dozens of prominent writers, actors and politicians is trying to collect one million signatures urging more liberal citizenship laws. 
West Germany<SEP>In the fourteen years of the Weimar Republic there were twenty Chancellors. Since 1949 there have been six Chancellors and Adenauer's period of office alone outlasted the whole of the Weimar period. The Chancellors of <ENT>West Germany<ENT> have been: Edinger has suggested two models of the Chancellor: a dominant Chancellor using political party as an instrument, and a constitutional Chancellor who leads a team of equal party leaders. 
USA<SEP>Even so I wasn't too late arriving and the check-in girl said our seats would be saved. But with delays in getting the bike to pieces, and in getting it through security, we arrived at boarding after the 15 min deadline and our seats had been given away. By missing the first flight we of course missed the connecting flight to the <ENT>USA<ENT> . I had visions of having to pay vast amounts as ` punishment ", but in the end they just re-scheduled our flights for one whole day later.
Britain<SEP>The discharge of sewage from boats has also contributed to eutrophication problems in the region (which is mainly due to runoff of fertilisers from adjacent arable land). The popularity of the area, which attracts some 2000 hired boats and 3000 private craft in the summer months (Crawford 1985), is gradually causing the impoverishment of what is generally considered to be one of Britain's most attractive wetland areas. There are also numerous reports that sailing and other water-based recreational sports can have adverse affects on water-birds that abound on many of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s artificially created reservoirs (e.g. Tuite 1982). This is a particular problem when sailing is extended into the winter period and can result in a reduction of overwintering species. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>Will the Secretary of State take it from me that the people of Northern Ireland will appreciate his expressions of sympathy and those of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman), directed to those who suffered in the terrible massacre that took place last night and to the relatives of the person who was murdered this morning? When the Secretary of State sees the Republican representatives again, will he put to them the revulsion that was felt by the Unionist community and by a large section of the Roman Catholic community in Northern Ireland when Mr. Haughey attempted to foist into the Anglo-Irish Conference a new Minister for Defence? It is clear from the man's record that he was an ally of a man who escaped from <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT> and who is wanted in Northern Ireland to pay part of the price for the crime that he committed. He was found guilty of attempting to murder an Ulster Defence Regiment man. 
Uruguay<SEP>Only for the British, the Danes and, to a lesser extent, the Dutch, is it about commerce. Not only does this constrain Britain's ability to win the internal-trade argument, it makes her position less than dominant on the question of Europe's attitude to the development of trade with third countries. The performance of the EEC during the <ENT>Uruguay<ENT> round of GATT discussions was instructive and probably a foretaste of what is to come. Whereas Britain took it as axiomatic that the objective of these negotiations was to reduce the general level of tariff barriers as a matter of good economic principle, her partners in Europe have viewed the matter from the other end of the telescope. 
Britain<SEP>This perspective is not confined to Britain; it is found in many countries, both developed and less developed. Estes and Binney (1988, p. 69) describe the image of older people in America as ` to be old is to be frail, sick, dependent and vulnerable ". The pervasiveness of this stereotype, especially in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, is probably the result of the interplay between several factors. Gerontological research has been heavily influenced by medical and biological theories which stress decline and sickness. 
Croatia<SEP>Calling of unofficial autonomy referendum In line with their July 25 proclamation of sovereignty and autonomy for the 600,000-strong Serb minority community in Croatia [ see p. 37622 ], community leaders organized in a so-called Serbian National Council issued a statement on July 31 rejecting amendments to the Croatian Constitution [ ibid. ]. Calling a referendum on demands for immediate cultural autonomy, they also demanded political and territorial autonomy for Serbs in <ENT>Croatia<ENT> if the latter was to gain greater sovereignty in a redefined Yugoslav confederation. Voting was to take place over two weeks beginning on Aug. 19. 
Pakistan<SEP>Pakistan's military appears instead to be concerned with the country's neighbour and traditional foe - India. Under the present Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, relations have warmed but Pakistan's military remains unconvinced. All <ENT>Pakistan<ENT>'s military resources, bolstered by 150,000 troops freed in February from the eastern border with Afghanistan, are directed at India. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. 
Britain<SEP>Environmental Politics UK political parties' environmental manifestos Each of the major political parties included detailed commitments in their manifestos for the general election held in <ENT>Britain<ENT> on 9 April. The Conservative manifesto called for: (i) the creation of an environmental agency with a statutory duty to publish an annual report on the state of the environment; (ii) possible stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions before the target date of 2005; (iii) expansion of the Countryside Stewardship Scheme to include conservation of historic landscapes; and (iv) the creation of a Wildlife Enhancement Scheme. 
Gibraltar<SEP>At the end of 1950, the co-author of a book advancing Spanish claims to various overseas territories, including Gibraltar, Fernando María Castiella, was appointed as Spanish Ambassador to London. This, however, proved to be too provocative a move: Castiella was refused agrément and was therefore unable to take up the London posting. In February 1951, a huge rally in support of Spanish sovereignty over <ENT>Gibraltar<ENT> was staged in Barcelona, and Franco declared 4 August " Gibraltar Day ". The United States showed no sign of wishing to intervene in Spain's quarrel with Britain over Gibraltar, but was not deterred from seeking closer relations with Spain. 
Britain<SEP>Disenchantment with the liberal establishment characteristic of the 1960s began to find expression in the work of a new generation of scholars at major universities and research institutes. They began to apply to the revolution the techniques and approaches, the concern with social history and with quantitative methods, already being widely applied in less sensitive fields. Moreover, following the Second World War, there was a great expansion of Russian studies in the West - in the USA, <ENT>Britain<ENT>, France, Germany, and rather later, in Israel and Japan. In no country was a concerted research plan adopted, but there was a rapid increase in the number of Russian and Soviet specialists. 
GREECE<SEP>EUROPE <ENT>GREECE<ENT> Resignation of Education Minister 
Britain<SEP>You look up one entry and are immediately seduced by adjacent items, just out of curiosity. For instance Jane's will tell you that Via Rail, the Canadian passenger railway, runs 12 intercity services every day with LRC trains. The LRC trains (LRC stands for light, rapid and comfortable) have tilting bodies, which allow them to take bends faster, just like <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s ill-fated advanced passenger trains. The LRCs have a maximum speed of 200 km/h, but are limited to 155 km/h because of the need to timetable them between slower freight trains. 
Netherlands<SEP>ISDN SERVICE BETWEEN JAPAN AND SINGAPORE UNDER WAY International Telecom Japan Ltd reports that it has started its ISDN service between Japan and Singapore, in co-operation with Singapore Telecom: it is in negotiation with other carriers and says it intends to extend its coverage to France and the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT>. 
Britain<SEP>Superkid gets six of best! BRILLIANT Matthew Woodcraft, 18, was hailed as <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s new superbrain yesterday. He matched the record of six A-level passes at grade A - AND got top marks in the Cambridge entrance exams. 
Gibraltar<SEP>Attacking the crude Marxist theory which treats history as a law-governed and predictable process, Trevor Roper points out that the Marxist historians failed to predict the rise of fascism. And how can anyone doubt, he goes on, that the course of the Second World War might in fact have been changed by a number of accidents. Three out of four of these accidents fix on the properties of individual men as decisive variables directing the course of events: had Churchill been a less charismatic politician Britain might have given up her fight against Germany; had Franco permitted an assault on <ENT>Gibraltar<ENT> it would probably have fallen; and if Mussolini had not ` taken it into his head " to invade Greece, Hitler would have moved into Russia. And then everything would have been different. 
Poland<SEP>The Kadets, at this time a middle-class reform party, promised cultural self-determination and equality for the peoples of the empire, but in a unitary State. At their 1905 Congress, the Social Revolutionaries, a peasant party, embraced the principle of national self-determination and a federal State. On the question of Poland, Lenin accepted much of Rosa Luxemburg's case that circumstances had qualitatively changed since the time of Marx - ` the restoration of <ENT>Poland<ENT>, prior to the fall of capitalism, is highly improbable, but it can not be asserted that it is absolutely impossible ". However, this was not the key issue for Great Russians, those who historically had participated in the dismemberment of Poland and oppressed its people. 
Britain<SEP>But P. C. Hardwick's Great Western Royal Hotel, which opened in the same year to provide the frontage to Paddington Station, was perhaps the earliest major building in Britain to show marked French Renaissance influence. Its external grandeur was matched by an enviable internal efficiency, facilitated by the most up-to-date equipment, including fireproof staircases, electric clocks, and an elaborate system of bells. It is interesting to observe how frequently the French style prevails not just in the building of hotels but in the whole ` architecture of pleasure " in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. It is as if somehow the puritanical, work-obsessed British associated the idea of ` pleasure " with the saucy, sinful Continent. 
Iraq<SEP>One can not be certain about that; one can only express an opinion as to the probability. A different point - again a very important one - relates to the general powers of the IAEA and to its ability to monitor civil programmes to prevent covert programmes. There we are working hard to boost the inspection powers of the IAEA to try to address problems of the kind that were thrown up in <ENT>Iraq<ENT>. Mr. Janner 
United States<SEP>At Key Biscayne, a week before he expected to be competing in the doubles against Czechoslovakia in their Davis Cup quarter finals, he even started outlining some of the changes he would make should he be given the job. After losing to Richard Krajicek in the fourth round in Key Biscayne, McEnroe outlined how he would try to do for American tennis what he has seen Yannick Noah achieve for France. ` The next step (in strengthening the <ENT>United States<ENT> team) is obvious to me. That's to have (Jim) Courier play. 
Virgin Islands<SEP>He had no idea what a tropical island cost, or even whether one was available, but it would be fun to investigate. A telephone call to London found an agent who specialised in such transactions, and an appointment was made. When Branson and Joan arrived in the <ENT>Virgin Islands<ENT>, they were sped effortlessly through Customs, conveyed by limousine to a private villa, and a helicopter was put at their disposal. Feeling fraudulent, but enjoying himself immensely, Branson went looking for an island. 
India<SEP>This was not done for imperial purposes, but once the navy had been developed it affected everything that happened in English policy. The government certainly had no money to spare to help the colonies, and this introduced the general rule that English colonies had to cover their own costs, both in the sense that the government of a colony had to raise enough revenue to pay its own bills and in the sense that there were no subsidies to encourage people to stay in a colony where they could not earn their own living. The result of these rules of practice was that the English set up colonies only in places where it was relatively easy to do so, at first because the places they went to were thinly populated, then because political disintegration in <ENT>India<ENT> enabled them to advance there, and because in the last phase of imperial expansion they had the sort of technological superiority needed for bringing most African rulers under their control. Because it was easy to launch them, a great diversity of colonies sprang up and usually they were neither compelled by any external danger nor persuaded by any liking for their neighbours to come to closer terms with one another. 
Lithuania<SEP>The president has ordered the police and KGB to prevent the construction of new customs posts. Most controversially, on March 21st he directed Lithuanians to surrender all weapons. <ENT>Lithuania<ENT>'s president, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, promptly called the decree illegal, and said it could be implemented only by ` brutal armed force ". Who will blink first? 
UK<SEP>HAND PICKED PROPERTIES No other <ENT>UK<ENT> operator knows Italy like Citalia - after all no one else has our specialist experience. Because we ourselves are Italian we live and breathe Italy and all things Italian, we see places all the year round - not just during a brief flying visit which is all other operators can afford. 
Uruguay<SEP>The annual meeting of the 44 countries holding shares in the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) took place in Nagoya, Japan, on April 7-9. This was the first time the meeting had been held in Asia, and representatives of the 25 American countries participating - including Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who was of Japanese parentage - reportedly regarded the meeting as an important forum for encouraging Japanese trade and investment links with the region. The IDB president, Enrique Iglesias of <ENT>Uruguay<ENT>, had said on April 4 that although Japanese investment had been rising in Chile, Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela, " we see potential for much more ". In the course of the meeting Japanese Deputy Finance Minister Makoto Utsumi underlined the demand for capital in eastern Europe and in the post-war Gulf. 
Guernsey<SEP>Really. Aurigny inaugurated services on 1st March 1968, flying a lone Islander. First trip went from Alderney to <ENT>Guernsey<ENT> wearing the now-familiar bright yellow and red livery, a colour scheme which has survived ever since. Sir Derek Bailey, a Gloucestershire businessman, picked up the route and formed the company when the former operator, British United Airways, pulled out of Alderney, leaving the island without the vital air link which so affects the island's economy. 
Zambia<SEP>He can't be more than 25 years old. And without an education or marketable skills Texas epitomizes the majority of Zambia's army of no-hopers, caught in a web of urban poverty from which escape is almost impossible. Speaking in the local Bemba dialect, Texas tells the story of Zambia's worst civil unrest in post-independence history - the 1986 food riots which arose from the burning desire of <ENT>Zambia<ENT>'s poorest people to survive. President Kaunda had been forced to implement an International Monetary Fund-inspired 120 per-cent-increase in the price of Zambia's staple food, maize meal. 
Albania<SEP>The Dinaric region In the plateau lands of Notranjsko the north-west to south-east trend line of the Dinaric system may be discerned, in contrast to the east-west line of the main Alpine system. The western Dinaric system consists of a series of parallel limestone ranges which run behind the Adriatic coast for 720 km (450 miles) from Slovenia to the Albanian border and continue through <ENT>Albania<ENT> to the Pindos mountains of Greece. The predominant rocks are Cretaceous limestones, although in the Velebit mountains of northern Dalmatia the rocks are of Jurassic age. 
India<SEP>These include the ` legacy of the British ", who promoted an overtly punitive penal philosophy, more concerned with the repression of dissent than with ordinary crime, and who ran the prisons as cheaply as possible; a labyrinthine criminal justice system, which causes many accused persons to spend years in gaol before their trial is completed; widespread political interference with the police, whereby criminals with ` connections " often escape justice, leaving the gaols populated predominantly with poor rural labourers; the designation of prisons, under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, as primarily the responsibility of the thirty-one individual states and union territories rather than the Indian government - which has perpetuated gross differences in practices and standards; and the generally low priority attached to ` non-productive " areas like penal reform in a country with 250 million people below the poverty line, where economic development dominates planning and expenditure. In the following pages, I shall first present a broad picture of the Indian prison population and the institutions in which it is held. This is followed by some general remarks about the history and philosophy of imprisonment in <ENT>India<ENT>, and a summary of previous writers' conclusions about gaol conditions. I shall then describe conditions in the central gaol I visited, ending with some comments about the possibilities and prospects for change. 
Spain<SEP>BBC pulls the plug on Eldorado soap THE BBC last night axed Eldorado, the supersoap set on the sunny Costa del Sol that turned into a multi-million pound flop. The news came as a crushing blow to the cast and production team on the £10million set in <ENT>Spain<ENT> who had hoped for a reprieve after a recent upturn in viewing figures. The new controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob, said he made the ` very hard " decision last night to halt the soap after its first 156 episodes end in July. 
America<SEP>Cormorants are only there for one reason: the lake is filled with fish. It is these that attract the star performer of Gol-Oya: the white-bellied sea eagle. The head of a master angler - the white-bellied sea eagle is a close relative of <ENT>America<ENT>'s national emblem, the bald eagle. This bird is a close relative of the African fish eagle and America's national emblem, the bald eagle. 
POLAND<SEP>EUROPE <ENT>POLAND<ENT> Rejection of anti-abortion bill 
Puerto Rico<SEP>A favourite trip is Sioux City, a visit to an old film set built for Spaghetti Westerns where you can eat as much as you like from the western-style barbecue. Eat, drink and be merry at the Medieval Night which includes a meal, free drinks and an open-air castle disco. Or spend the day aboard an Onedin Line style ship on our Cruise, or see <ENT>Puerto Rico<ENT> by night. These are just an example of the excellent trips available in gran Canaria - they cost around £15 each, less if you buy the whole package, and most trips include plenty to eat and often a free bar! 
Israel<SEP>Monolayer films that assemble themselves MONOLAYER films - layers of material just one molecule thick - have many potential uses, ranging from the construction of synthetic biological membranes to micro-electronic applications (see New Scientist vol 95, p 912). Now Lucy Netzer and Jacob Sagiv, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot in <ENT>Israel<ENT> have developed a simpler and quicker technique for preparing monolayer films that relies simply on the chemical properties of the starting materials. In effect the molecules assemble themselves (Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol 105, p 674). 
US<SEP>US dollar and other currency convertability. 4. Regulation Q of the <ENT>US<ENT> banking system. 5. 
UK<SEP>Shortening product life cycles and rapid product proliferation mean that investment in innovation is critical in global competition. As a result, innovation now figures high on the agendas of chief executives across the world, and their concerns are backed up by figures which show a strong correlation, for the US at least, between investment in R&D and long term growth. <ENT>UK<ENT> industry, for its part, invests a smaller proportion of output in R&D than its main competitors, and more recent data on R&D as a percentage of sales, as well as data on patent levels, tells a similar story. Nevertheless, despite concerns about the level of UK research expenditure, the UK science base remains exceptionally strong as a source of innovation. 
Greece<SEP>GREECE KKE congress - 1992 budget - Expulsion of Albanians The 14th congress of the Communist Party of <ENT>Greece<ENT> (KKE-Exterior), held in Athens on Dec. 18-22, re-elected Aleka Papariga as general secretary. The session provided the opportunity for conservative currents within the party to reassert themselves, following the split in July when reformist members had shifted their allegiance to the Left Alliance [ see pp. 38021; 38115; 38357 ]. 
United States<SEP>By the beginning of 1991 the number of seats held by the CIP had increased from 12 to 14 - one member of the DP having defected to the CIP, and the sole independent member having joined the CIP - thereby giving the party, in alliance with the DTP, the two-thirds majority required to enact constitutional changes. Although Henry stated that he favoured constitutional reform - including an increase in the size of the Cabinet and a greater recognition of the role of political parties - he denied suggestions that his eventual aim was to achieve complete independence from New Zealand. Prime Minister Henry met <ENT>United States<ENT> President Bush on April 18, 1990 during a three-day private visit to the USA. The meeting was described by US State Department spokeswoman as primarily a " get-acquainted session ". 
Iraq<SEP>For C B S this was the greatest coup in the coverage of the crisis. Dan Rather asked if Hussein would withdraw from Kuwait. Kuwait is part of <ENT>Iraq<ENT>. Forever? 
Pakistan<SEP>It seemed that mortalities were the norm and survivals were very rare. A second bitch was acquired by Captain Roy-Smith, Lotte v Osterburg, who was a much better breeding prospect and foundation for the breed in this country. She was mated to Ajax and produced two litters, the first one, in 1938, contained five dogs, four of which apparently went to India and <ENT>Pakistan<ENT>, for reasons which seem to be obscure. The only dog that remained in this country was Rintelna The Bombadier, who was bought by Mary MacPhail. 
UK<SEP>At the time of writing, the status of Andorra and San Marino remains uncertain, but the latest indications are that Andorra will be excluded while San Marino will be included. EC sales listing From 1 January any <ENT>UK<ENT> business that sells goods to another VAT registered person in another country within the EC will have to complete one of these statements on a period basis. Normally this will be within six weeks of the end of the calendar quarter, but smaller businesses whose sales to other EC countries in a year do not exceed £10,500 out of a total turnover of £59,500, need only submit a list of their customers' registration numbers on an annual basis. 
New Jersey<SEP>In the first season after the new track was installed, Harvard's runners increased their speeds by an average of 3 per cent. Furthermore, the injury rate on the softer track dropped to less than half what it had been on the previous track. There are now four such ` tuned tracks " in America: at Harvard, Yale, Madison Square Garden in New York, and at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in <ENT>New Jersey<ENT>. But there is no outdoor super-track, and thus no one has tried to break the world record, for the 1500 metres on one. 
India<SEP>By Harry Pincott A PLAYERS' revolt at London Scottish has led to the resignation of the coaching staff and the First XV taking over the coaching in the run-up to the last four league games. When Alastair McHarg left for a month's business trip to <ENT>India<ENT> last week, he left sevens supremo and club stalwart, Andy Cushing, along with Mike Lovett, in charge of the coaching until his return next month. However, a players' meeting, led by captain Richard Cramb, decided that they had no confidence in the two left to mind the shop in McHarg's absence. 
France<SEP>Sabine had asked if she had any grandparents in France, or any other uncles and aunts. It seemed unjust if she was saddled with Aunt Ruth alone, but Isabelle had said there was no one, adding, ` Hélas. " The other odd thing, she realised, was that they'd never been on holiday to <ENT>France<ENT>. Nor could she recollect that it had ever been suggested they should do so. 
Iraq<SEP>The allies, though, insist that the Kurds must not only be safe but be made to feel safe, which means no armed police; British commandos were sent to see them off. The Turks, no longer under pressure to take the refugees in, question why the Kurds are being coaxed into half-way camps, rather than taken directly all the way to their own abandoned front doors. Some of their old fears of a Kurdish entity in <ENT>Iraq<ENT> faded when they were contemplating only a ` protected " enclave, taking in Kurdish towns and villages, and turning to Turkey for succour. ` When I look I don't see a Kurdish state, " said Turkey's ambassador to Iraq, ` just 400,000 miserable people. " 
Ethiopia<SEP>International: Million facing famine death in Ethiopia By Michael Smith, Foreign Staff MORE than a million people in southern <ENT>Ethiopia<ENT> are at risk of starvation in a famine that has killed 5,000 in five months, according to the country's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission. The effects of the famine, which follows two years of drought, have been exacerbated by the non-arrival of foreign aid and fighting between clans for control of the southern provinces. 
India<SEP>Habitat: <ENT>India<ENT>, Malaysia, Sri Lanka. 
Britain<SEP>Areas found to be at risk include ancient woodlands dating back to the last ice age, internationally rare lowland heaths, meadows and marshes containing many rare species of plants, flowers, animals, birds and insects. The New Forest and Butterwood in Hampshire, threatened by several roads, are the subject of case studies identifying flora and fauna of special interest. The New Forest contains plant and animal species unique in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, including wild gladioli and New Forest cicada. Butterwood has the richest woodland flora in Hampshire, together with a wide variety of insects, including 25 species of butterfly. 
Britain<SEP>Social history In the middle decades of the nineteenth century a disastrous crop failure destroyed the economic base of the Scottish highlands, which led to mass emigration and encouraged a new series of peasant evictions. The research aims to provide a comprehensive account of the last subsistence crisis in mainland <ENT>Britain<ENT>, by tracing its origins, the experience of the society during it and the long-term demographic, social and economic consequences for the highland area as a whole. The research will be based on archival sources and newspaper and government reports held in depositories in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London. 
Britain<SEP>WORKERS at Britain's only potash mine at Boulby near Staithes are expecting a boost in their pay packets. After a two-year freeze on wage rises, management at Cleveland Potash have agreed a five per cent increase for the 956 employees, backdated to January 1. A mild winter has led to a drop off in sales of salt to local authorities and there has also been a reduction in the market for potash in <ENT>Britain<ENT> as a result of the uncertain future in farming. However, the company is still hauling 750,000 tonnes of potash each year from seams deep under the North Sea and is building up an increasing export market. 
UK<SEP>The project was the first publicly funded research investigation and evaluation of the linguistic and educational aspects of the university language curriculum in UK French studies. The issues examined include the role of video in the learning process, communicative grammar (the grammar of combined sentences), and the communicative method. The course was pilot-tested in the <ENT>UK<ENT>, Australia, and New Zealand. It was evaluated by the Edinburgh University Gordon Thompson Unit, with total success, and published as a student course book and tutor's guide, with two videotape material cassettes. 
Thailand<SEP>(The number of illiterates in the world was estimated at 1,000 million, including some 35 per cent of all women.) The world literacy campaign aimed to provide primary education for 80 per cent of children under 14 by the year 2000. [ For world education conference held in Jomtien, <ENT>Thailand<ENT> on March 5-9, 1990, see p. 37335. ] UNICEF 
Germany<SEP>NOW that the blush of embarrassment at their mixed showing in the Gulf war has worn off, Europeans have gone back to doing what they do best: dickering over abstractions. In Washington this week <ENT>Germany<ENT>'s Helmut Kohl insisted that uniting Europe would not mean undermining NATO. But Europe's obsession with clearing a path to a common foreign and defence policy risks doing just that. 
UK<SEP>Various matters relating to FECS and ECCC activities were noted, particularly the proposals for the establishment of the concept of ` European Chemist ". 0 Reports on stop-over visits funded by the RSC were received. These included visits to Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the <ENT>UK<ENT> and Vietnam. Batches of journals had been despatched to Nepal, Pakistan and Romania under the IC's scheme for the provision of back issues to needy institutions overseas. 
Canada<SEP>The user interface management system enables developers to prototype hardware-independent, user-configurable graphical user interfaces for their applications in real time - a user can switch from Open Look to Motif without recompiling. The company claims the use of the CORBA as the backbone of the system allows resources to be plugged in and out without affecting existing applications, so that the newest technology components can be used. Mozaic is scheduled for the first quarter 1993 for manufacturing companies in the US and <ENT>Canada<ENT> and will be released to third-party systems integrators in Europe in the second quarter. 
Britain<SEP>THE TOURIST CHARTER Brighton and Hove lay great emphasis on the quality and value for money offered by their holiday accommodation. All hotels and guest houses listed in this brochure comply with a Tourist Charter which sets standards which are amongst the highest of any resort in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. Brighton and Hove's minimum standards are roughly equivalent to the ` Two Crown " classification adopted by the English Tourist Board (the ETB's national ` Crown " Classification scheme has six categories: from the basic ` Listed " through to ` Five Crowns "). 
Syria<SEP>Farewell to the Luck of Eden Hall Ever since that time, the fate of the Musgrave family and the strangely beautiful glass goblet have been regarded as inextricably entwined. The vessel is described as being about six inches tall and it has been suggested that it may have been used as a chalice, and it might have originated in Spain or <ENT>Syria<ENT> and been brought home to England from one of the Crusades. But whatever the origins the fairy folk warning has never been left to chance and the ` Luck " still exists; it is either locked away in a strong room on the premises or according to some accounts stored safely in the custody of the Bank of England. 
United Kingdom<SEP>At birth, a baby in India has an expectation of life of 32 years; in Mexico, 39 years; in the United Arab Republic, 38 years. The United States baby can expect a life span of 70 years, and in the United Kingdom this rises to 71 years. Once a child has survived his vulnerable first five years, his expectation of life naturally increases, but this increase will vary in direct proportion to the dangers which he has so far evaded: thus the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> 5 year old can now expect to live until he is 75, the American until he is 72. The Indian child, however, once he is 5, increases his expectation from 32 to 46 years; the Mexican, from 39 to 55 years- and the 5 year old of the United Arab Republic can now expect to live to the age of 59, having added 21 years to his total expectation of life by virtue of having survived the ` pre-school " period (UNICEF, 1964). 
Iraq<SEP>Iraq's shareholdings in America seem to have been restricted to a machine-tool firm in Ohio and an engineering consultancy in California. Both companies are thought by western intelligence to be part of Iraq's international arms-procurement network and both have links with Anees Wadi, a suspected Iraqi agent who was expelled from Britain last year. If confirmed, these revelations make a bit of a mockery of the financial sanctions imposed on <ENT>Iraq<ENT> in August. At the time it was insisted that virtually all Iraqi and Kuwaiti money in the West had been identified and frozen. 
Lebanon<SEP>When a Palestinian political identity began to emerge after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war - when the West Bank and Gaza Strip were occupied by the Israeli army - the promise contained in these mundane implements and pieces of paper was somehow renewed. Reminders of humiliation once again became priceless possessions, as emotionally valuable as they had once been legally essential. In <ENT>Lebanon<ENT>, where the Palestinian war against Israel was focused once the PLO's guerrilla movement was evicted from Jordan in 1970, they were squirrelled away beneath floors or carpets, sometimes stored in rusting biscuit tins, broken suitcases and ancient trunks, often the very containers in which the refugees carried their most valuable belongings from Palestine in 1948. Each document is signed by a British mandate official and gives in detail the figures of sale and settlement in the name of the Palestinian who inherited or bought the land. 
USSR<SEP>The Financial Times of Sept. 7 observed that the decree " amounts to a belated admission by the Soviet authorities of the sorry state of discipline in the military, with widespread tales of racial discrimination, bullying, gang warfare, and chronic disregard for safety regulations in soldiers' training ". By-election win for KGB whistle-blower Kalugin Oleg Kalugin, a former major-general in the KGB who had come to public prominence recently for alleging continuing KGB abuses of power, was elected to the <ENT>USSR<ENT> Congress of People's Deputies in a by-election in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar on Sept. 2. A KGB operative and counterintelligence officer for 32 years, Kalugin had been forced to retire in March, apparently because he had complained to the CPSU central committee and in letters to Gorbachev about the need for fundamental reforms of the KGB. 
Switzerland<SEP>By contrast, on Nov. 9 over 100,000 demonstrators in 100 German cities protested against racism on the anniversary of " Kristallnacht " in 1938, when the wholesale destruction by the Nazis of synagogues and Jewish property took place [ see pp. 3323-24 ]. [ For November anti-racist attack on Netherlands Interior Ministry see p. 38590. ] There were attacks on asylum centres in <ENT>Switzerland<ENT> [ see p. 38497 for increase in number of asylum seekers in Switzerland ]. In Italy, where tougher immigration legislation laws had been approved in 1990 [ see p. 37507-08 ], the government sought to repatriate thousands of Albanian refugees during 1991 as well as to provide economic assistance to Albania to reduce the influx [ see p. 38105-06; 38400 ]. 
Finland<SEP>` The Hib vaccine is both safe and effective with no serious side effects, " said Rebecca Weston of Meningitis Research. ` The encouraging news is that in countries such as Finland and the USA where vaccination against Hib disease had been extensively administered the incidence of this form of meningitis has been dramatically reduced. ` In Helsinki, <ENT>Finland<ENT>, they haven't seen a case for nearly two years. This gives us hope. 
Vietnam<SEP>In the case of Reagan many had doubts about his age, his competence, his inexperience and his tendency towards extremism. If elected he would be almost seventy as he took office; some spectacular gaffes during the campaign did not inspire confidence. He described the <ENT>Vietnam<ENT> war as a ` noble cause ", charged that Carter's economic policy had caused a ` severe depression " and raised doubts about the theory of evolution. Reagan, furthermore, notwithstanding executive experience as a two-term governor of California, was totally without national political experience and was a complete novice in foreign affairs. 
Mongolia<SEP>Multiparty elections National and local elections <ENT>Mongolia<ENT>'s first multiparty elections were held on July 29. The elections had been called in mid-May as part of a package of political reforms which included the introduction of a multiparty system and the creation of a standing legislature [ see p. 37454 ]. 
France<SEP>Clones of Sun's 45MHz models 52 and 54 boxes and 50MHz models 62 and 64 will be introduced as and when Sun ships. The systems are assembled by Dataman in Germany. The firm says it is able to offer Sun compatible boxes at such low prices because it buys components as a group and sells through catalogues in Germany, Netherlands, UK, Austria, Switzerland and <ENT>France<ENT>. In the UK, Dataman claims to have sold 15 Solair 10/30 and Classic boxes and expects to sell 100 by the end of the year - 2,000 across Europe.

Jamaica<SEP>In August 1767 he was granted a coat of arms with the motto ` Safely, quickly and pleasantly " and married Rachel, widow of William Westley of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, and daughter of Simon and Frances Warlock of Antigua and Westminster. They were to have one son, Daniel, born in 1768, and a daughter, Frances. The inoculating business had now reached its zenith with forty-seven ` authorized " partnerships (including Sutton, his father, and six brothers) in England, Ireland, Wales, Holland, France, <ENT>Jamaica<ENT>, and Virginia in 1768. By about 1769 Sutton began to be superseded as first-choice inoculator of the wealthy by Thomas Dimsdale [ q.v. ]. 
Ireland<SEP>As early as Al) 1250, Norman leaders had subjugated most of Ireland's Gaelic population. Fifty years of guerrilla-style rebellion by the Gaels gradually reduced the amount of territory controlled by the invaders to a small enclave around Dublin, known as the Pale. There settlers established the earliest English plantation in <ENT>Ireland<ENT>. Further attempts by the English to extend their presence in Ireland were successfully resisted. 
Britain<SEP>In the wake of the OPEC crisis, for example, oil exploration increased elsewhere, including in the North Sea, and dependence on Middle East supplies reduced. Although a 1988 nuclear industry advert said that oil supplies could ` dry up " in about sixty years, others set the figure for known reserves (at current rates of consumption) at nearer 200 years. Coal reserves have also expanded worldwide, with <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s contribution expected to last several hundred years. Proven reserves of natural gas have also increased.

Germany<SEP>On May 5 a US Defence Department spokesperson announced that the US contribution to the war costs had been almost US$6,000 million, out of a total cost of US$61,000 million. Most of the Saudi contribution was paid in cash, with $US4,000 million in services and fuel. Saudi Arabia was the biggest contributor, with <ENT>Germany<ENT>, Japan, Kuwait, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates also major contributors. Libel damage award to Wafiq Said

Japan<SEP>Relations with Korea were not formalized until the conclusion (under threat of military confrontation) of the Treaty of Kanghwa in February 1876. The imposition on Korea of an unequal treaty was the first stage in a sustained attempt by Japan to secure dominant influence in the peninsula. The argument over formal relations was the first of a succession of Japanese disputes with Korea and with other countries concerning Korea, which have formed a very substantial part of the story of <ENT>Japan<ENT>'s relations with both Asia and the West. During the first two decades of the Meiji period the Japanese continued to take a strong interest in Korea. 
Kuwait<SEP>The civilian population in Kuwait appeared to be stunned by the invasion, and although some immediately tried to escape into Saudi Arabia most simply remained in their homes. Some reports suggested that the invasion was supported by large numbers of the estimated 400,000 Palestinian workers in Kuwait, all of whom had previously been denied Kuwaiti citizenship despite constituting the backbone of the country's middle-management structure. Over 1,000,000 other expatriates lived in <ENT>Kuwait<ENT>, more than half of whom were south or south-east Asian. The deposed Kuwaiti government established its base in the Saudi mountain resort of Taif, although the Amir and his ministers spent much of their time travelling the world to bolster opposition to the invasion. 
Peru<SEP>But once their god-king had renounced his authority, their conversion had been easily achieved. Then, drifting into the sombre silences, I heard the insistent, unimaginative but slightly humorous ta-ra thump-thump brass and drums of a military band. I squeezed my way out to find at the foot of the cathedral steps the white helmets of a military band celebrating Easter state-style, surrounded by the boy soldiers of <ENT>Peru<ENT> in grey, black and khaki, armed with machine-guns. A commando unit, wearing black jerseys, gloves and skull-caps, armed with bazookas, marched past. 
Croatia<SEP>Meanwhile, the British mission in New York is in constant touch with the secretary general and his staff and I have alredy told the House of Sir David Hannay's helpful discussion with Mr. Vance yesterday. Mr. Michie While the Secretary of State has tried to assure the House about the problems and implications of recognition of <ENT>Croatia<ENT>, will he try once more to reassure us about that recognition? Does it refer to territory already held by the Croatians or does it apply to old frontiers which are up for grabs? 
US<SEP>Blacklisted vitamins on sale in Britain A ` DIETARY supplement " known as B15, that is regarded as potentially dangerous by <ENT>US<ENT> health authorities, is still on sale in West Germany and Britain, says the EEC's environment commissioner, Hans Narjes.

Brazil<SEP>Mr Collor's National Reconstruction Party was created as an election vehicle and has only a handful of members. His attempt to win southern gaucho voters by playing up family links there backfired when he got his regional expressions muddled up. His campaign now seems to be down to its last card - to brand Mr Da Silva as a dangerous radical who is bent on introducing Stalinist communism into <ENT>Brazil<ENT>. ` They will replace the green and yellow of the national flag with red, " he warns. 
Vietnam<SEP>A subjective camera, filming through goggles, picks out the inane faces and soundless mouths of his elders as he descends to the bottom of the pool where he stands silently and alone, away from the pestering people above. Skilful and creative editing enables Nichols to show a time-passing sequence as Benjamin moves smoothly from his bed to Mrs Robinson's, from stretching out on a raft in the pool to stretching out on top of her. Unlike his hero and Dustin, Charles Webb and his wife Eva (nicknamed Fred), protested against the <ENT>Vietnam<ENT> War and rebelled against their affluent background. Webb's father was a wealthy LA doctor who was outraged by the novel, which he considered mocked his lifestyle. 
America<SEP>` They don't know the power of what they're up against. They won't define it. They pinch most of what they say from the student press in <ENT>America<ENT> and throw in a few tags from Colonel Ojukwu. Never enough to be serious.

Marion Zunz was a wildlife film-maker whose innovative ideas contributed to the BBC's Natural History Unit programmes such as Animal Magic, Wildtrack and The Natural World. 
West Germany<SEP>All seemed set fair for an excellent autumn, but change comes when you least expect it. We began to tire of eating charred meat outside in the garden and, instead of the normal seasonal rise in pig prices, they moved sharply into reverse. The abundant supply of other meats and new sources of pigs from Eastern block countries, flowing into the EEC through the newly opened border between East and <ENT>West Germany<ENT>, meant that quite suddenly the honeymoon period was over. Coupled with this, the rains eventually did come. 
Romania<SEP>The last Soviet troops left the country in 1958 and Romania has not taken part in any Warsaw Pact exercises since 1968. This has left the armed forces short of modern equipment. <ENT>Romania<ENT> has the worst equipped army in the Warsaw Pact. A third of its 1,800 main battle tanks are of Second World War vintage, and most of the remainder date from the 1950s.

UK<SEP>In the application of COB Rules under the foreign business carve-out as such (see page 40 above), the relevant test is whether the customer is physically in the UK. The SFA's marketing rules will not apply Except for the need to make the prescribed disclosure (see page 41 above), the retained marketing rules that non-UK offices have to comply with despite the foreign business carve-out apply only where the firm is carrying on investment business in the <ENT>UK<ENT> . This will not be the case, however, if the non-UK office deals only with customers outside the UK, or executes transactions only outside the UK for a customer in the UK unless it gives advice to the customer.
US<SEP>First, it never represented a major investment outlet for US business as a whole. Taking the years 1956-70, if all (net) US direct investment overseas had instead been invested in the United States, gross private investment there would have increased only by around 4 per cent. Second, this investment abroad was not financed out of domestic profits; over the same period <ENT>US<ENT> business received profits from its past investment overseas equivalent to around 1¼ times as much as it was sending overseas. While switching towards Europe (where 31 per cent of US direct investment was located in 1970 as compared to 15 per cent in 1955) from Latin America (where the share fell from 38 per cent to 19 per cent) and from mining and petroleum to manufacturing (32 per cent in 1950, 41 per cent in 1970), on average US overseas investment more than financed itself. 
Britain<SEP>1. The black population of London was estimated at between fourteen and twenty thousand in the eighteenth century, or 2.2 per cent of the total (Alexander and Dewjee 1981). During the period of the slave trade and plantation labour in the West Indies, a certain number of black Caribbeans found their way to <ENT>Britain<ENT>, frequently as sailors or as slaves or servants accompanying their masters. During the nineteenth century their numbers declined, due to intermarriage and emigration (for example, several hundred went to Sierra Leone in 1787: Henderson 1960.) 
Britain<SEP>HAROLD BROOKS-BAKER/Burke's Peerage Voice over As the eldest son of the eleventh Duke of Marlborough, Jamie Blandford stands in line to inherit one of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s greatest stately homes, Blenheim Palace. But there's renewed speculation that the Duke is seeking to disinherit his eldest son, in favour of his younger son, Edward, after a Sunday magazine interview with Lady Blandford, Jamie's wife. 
Germany<SEP>A senior French official [hellip] explains, ` What is disturbing in the German attitude is that it betrays a very hegemonial mentality. Germany wants all the European currencies at her feet, and she is on the point of abusing her dominant position.' The Italians joined the French by attacking the deflationary effect of <ENT>Germany<ENT>'s dominant position on their economy. They felt that this prevented other countries from ever catching up with her. 
Mozambique<SEP>According to spokesperson Richard Jolly: ` It is the equivalent of one child dying every four minutes, or a primary school of 380 pupils being killed each day. These findings are tragic, far worse than people realize. " In its report ` Children on the Frontline " UNICEF shows that mortality rates in Angola and <ENT>Mozambique<ENT> are among the highest in the world because of underdevelopment compounded by the war and economic destabilization. The two countries are fighting against South-African backed rebels: the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the Mozambique National Resistance group (MNR).

America<SEP>The commercial-paper market offers only short-term financing. The bond market is again exclusive. And <ENT>America<ENT>'s hard-pressed banks are in no mood for adventurous lending. Matters have been made worse by the way investment banks scrambled to do junk-bond deals after federal investigators closed in on Mr Milken.

Foreign companies' filing Draft Companies House guidance for foreign companies operating in the <ENT>UK<ENT> may not be clear enough for the companies to be sure they are acting within the law, according to the Institute. Under new proposals, companies incorporated in other EC member states will have to file certain details with Companies House if they have a ` branch " in the UK, while non-EC companies will have to file if they have a ` place of business " here. 
China<SEP>Torture and execution were the fate not only of those suspected of conniving with anti-Japanese activity, but of thousands of innocent Chinese. In so-called Free China distress was acute; resistance was a priority, and even away from the war zone few escaped the effects of the spiralling inflation which beset the non-agricultural sector. Unlike Manchuria or Korea, occupied <ENT>China<ENT> was not economically exploited, let alone developed, by the Japanese, except in the crudest manner. The essentially transient regime left behind little but resentment and destruction. 
JORDAN<SEP>MIDDLE EAST - ARAB WORLD <ENT>JORDAN<ENT> Economic developments 
Ukraine<SEP>Our experience and wide range of multi-disciplinary skills enable us to tackle complex and difficult tasks. Among these, AEA is actively helping the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union clean up various types of contamination resulting from Chernobyl and a variety of other nuclear and non-nuclear activities. Following extensive international concern over the levels of safety of the older power reactors in the former USSR, AEA has been appointed to manage an international programme of safety evaluation for RBMK-type reactors in Russia, Lithuania and <ENT>Ukraine<ENT>. We are also a member of another European Commission-funded international consortium which is evaluating the safety of VVER reactors in Ukraine and Bulgaria. 
South Africa<SEP>Education as the arena of conflict: El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, <ENT>South Africa<ENT> and Namibia Finally, we come to a group of countries in which state policy on education is not only constrained by external economic and political pressures but also starkly reflects the priorities of a small and exclusive élite. 
US<SEP>In return, the USA and her West European allies offered to halt the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles, which were to be supplied to the NATO powers later in 1983. Nearer home Reagan displayed in Central America readiness to back established and sometimes reactionary governments against left-wing guerrilla movements, as in El Salvador, or opposition to left-wing governments, as in Nicaragua. The presence of a growing number of <ENT>US<ENT> military " advisers " and of US warships in the area led critics of the government to fear " another Vietnam ". Moreover, by November 1983 American soldiers had gone into action in the Middle East, as the major element in a United Nations force attempting to open a way to peace in the Lebanon, long battered by civil war; and in the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, where, following a coup within the island's Marxist-dominated government, the Reagan Administration - fearful of Cuban activities - had sent in the Marines, an action condemned by the United Nations.

Britain<SEP>GERRY ECKERSLEY Organizer Voice over It's billed as a dog agility extravaganza, as hundreds of pets compete across the Three Counties showground in Malvern.Over the next six days the dogs will be leaping over hurdles, jumping through hoops, and careering through tunnels.Their performances are being timed, and on Sunday morning the pick of the bunch will compete for the title of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s most agile dog. Almost all breeds are here [hellip] although Border collies tend to dominate the proceedings. 
Romania<SEP>The cost of the Civic Centre project in Bucharest was enormous but it was not the fundamental cause of the poverty of Romania. The Casa Republicii was the symbol of Ceau[scedil]escu's indifference to the well-being of the current generation of Romanians as much as Versailles was the embodiment of Louis XIV's quest for glory regardless of the sufferings of his own people. The palace complex was just part of the Conducator's plans to transform <ENT>Romania<ENT> as a whole. When Albert Speer reflected on the enormous scale of Hitler's architectural ambitions, it dawned upon him that Germany alone could never supply the raw materials for the monuments and new cities planned by the Führer. 
UK<SEP>They will act in a facilitating role to help in focusing on more general social and economic need. One of the problems with economic cycles is that they create surpluses and slacks in demand which affect the stability of the work force. The traditional role of governments in the <ENT>UK<ENT> has been to ease the pressures on both companies and individuals by some form of intervention - subsidies, loans or payments etc. In recent years the Employment Department and the Department of Trade and Industry have been responsible for appropriate interventions but they have been more of a fire fighting nature than a sustained development of policy and role - which in any case, has not been the way government departments have tended to behave since they are organised to implement government policy in the immediate rather than long term. 
Spain<SEP>No one - least of all your guests - wants you to be preparing in the kitchen for hours, so go for freshness, and all the light and colourful foods available during these summer months. On the following pages we offer a selection of rather special recipes created for just such occasions. On pages 12 and 13, a Spanish extravaganza: 1992 is very much the year of <ENT>Spain<ENT>, so why not celebrate it?

Cambodia<SEP>But looting continues apace as locals try to supplement their monthly earnings of around $3 a month. More than 1,000 objects have been removed from Angkor alone, and decapitated statues are everywhere. At the conference, the Director of the National Museum in Phnom Penh, Pich Keo, asked Unesco to pass information on stolen property to Interpol and the International Council of Museums, and made a plea to museum directors to research the provenance of objects in their collections, and to return those illegally exported from <ENT>Cambodia<ENT>. Prince M.C. Subhadradis Diskul, Director of the seameo Regional Centre for Archaeology and Fine Arts, Bangkok, said Thailand is willing to return stolen property only when it can be fully documented with photographs which is rarely possible after the damages inflicted by the Khmer Rouge. 
China<SEP>Dissent - Continued crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators In November 1989 a press campaign was mounted to vilify leaders of the Paris-based dissident organization Federation for a Democratic China and its sympathizers. The federation had been formally set up in Paris on Sept. 22 by leaders of the pro-democracy movement who had fled <ENT>China<ENT>, including leading economists Yan Jiaqi and Chen Yizi, and Wan Runnan, head of China's biggest private company, the Stone Co. [ see also p. 36815 ]. (Yan Jiaqi and student dissident leader Wuer Kaixi had in early July released a videotaped statement in France announcing the formation of a differently named organization - see p. 36815.) 
Greenland<SEP>I can see only one emergency following upon another as wave follows upon wave [hellip], ". It seems to me that the same is true of the much older history of Europe, which is the subject of this book. Of course, the historical analogy is not a completely valid one, for history only concerns the interactions within a single species during a few thousand years, in connection with which geological and climatological changes have played only a minor role (as in the extinction of Carthage and of the Viking settlements in <ENT>Greenland<ENT>). Many geologists have, like the allegedly wiser men mentioned by Fisher, claimed to see patterns in earth history. 
United States<SEP>The largest percentage decrease in mortality during these three decades is shown by women aged 75 - 84. These trends are not unique to Britain and may be observed in various countries. For example, in the <ENT>United States<ENT> there was a 16 per cent decline in mortality rates among males aged 85 + and 36 per cent among females of the same age during the period 1965 - 85 (Verbrugge 1989). The reasons for these declines in late-age mortality are not well understood but probably reflect a variety of factors including better health care and improvements in nutrition and other aspects of living conditions as well as improvements in the availability and quality of medical care. 
Kenya<SEP>Although charges against most of the FORD leaders were dropped by the end of the month, Ahmed Salim Bamahriz, who had escaped arrest earlier in the month, was detained in Mombasa on Nov. 25. Strained foreign relations Relations between <ENT>Kenya<ENT> and the USA and other Western states deteriorated sharply as a result of the government's response to FORD's demands and activities. On Nov. 13 Moi had warned foreign diplomats to stay away from the rally, and a Foreign Ministry official said that diplomats who attended the rally " would be violating international conventions on diplomacy ".

Mexico<SEP>Marie Murphy then provides a musical interlude with her essay ` Down To The Woods ", in which she takes a look at the career of that great Ulster songwriter, the late Jimmy Kennedy. It is fascinating to learn how some of Kennedy's most famous compositions were inspired by seemingly inconsequential incidents. For example, he once received a postcard from his mother and sisters which said: ` Today we gone to <ENT>Mexico<ENT> - south of the border ". Thus was born that timeless and much recorded hit ` South Of The Border Down Mexico Way ". 
Germany<SEP>Hundreds of clergy and laity, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, lost their lives in the Germany of the Third Reich. Many have been killed in the political struggles of South America and in the missionary work in Africa, and many are still persecuted in many communist countries. The twentieth century has its own Christian martyrs: St Maximilian Kolbe, who exchanged places with a condemned Jew in the concentration camp and was starved along with his fellow prisoners, before being fatally injected with carbolic acid; Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a minister of the Confessing Church of <ENT>Germany<ENT>, who was executed by the Nazis; and Archbishop Romero, gunned down when he was at a prayer meeting. For each martyr well known, there are thousands who are little remembered but who suffered death because they were disciples of Christ. 
Pescadores Islands<SEP>Both wanted to extend their influence in the same region. In 1894 war broke out between Japan and China over competing rights and interests in Korea. Japan's newly modernized armed forces achieved a resounding victory, and the terms of the peace treaty exacted from the Chinese not only a massive indemnity, but also the cession to Japan of Formosa (Taiwan), the <ENT>Pescadores Islands<ENT> and the Liaodong peninsula, which lay off the Manchurian coast west of Korea. The war marked Japan's acquisition of her first colonies, and made her a force to be reckoned with in East Asian affairs. 
Canada<SEP>From Sri Lanka Eva went to <ENT>Canada<ENT> for a world conference of Salvation Army leaders. Then it was back home to Australia for a bit of " spoiling " from the brothers and sisters. 
France<SEP>If the firm gets into difficulty, its bankers become intimately involved in restructuring or liquidating the firm. This project aims to develop models which take these factors into account, and so to understand how they affect investment decisions. This work will provide some of the theoretical foundations for an empirical project on the provision of funds for industry in <ENT>France<ENT>, Germany, Japan, UK and USA, run through the Centre for Economic Policy Research by Margaret Bray, Jeremy Edwards and Colin Mayer. 
America<SEP>Another conference was held a few months later at Geneva, when France's colonial war in Indochina was brought to an end. But a new crisis then broke out in NATO which made further talks with Russia impossible: after four years of discussion about West German rearmament, on 30 August the French parliament finally rejected EDC. Dulles had already warned that the defeat of EDC would provoke an ` agonising reappraisal " of US defence policy, hinting at a retreat from Europe to ` Fortress <ENT>America<ENT> ". Americans were exasperated that they should be paying for Europe's defence when the Europeans were not doing their utmost to help themselves. 
UK<SEP>They categorised all applicants, genuine or otherwise, who were unable or unwilling to specify their long term intentions, as necessarily falling outside the ambit of the rules and thus doomed to inevitable failure when applying for entry clearance. The essence of what Mr Hussain said was that following the marriage he would remain in England on a settled basis as a married man for just so long as his wife dictated. And for good measure, it should be noted that the ECO long ago expressed his own conclusion that settlement in the <ENT>UK<ENT> was the intention in this case. The tribunal's decision was quashed and the appeal restored for hearing as an appeal against a refusal of entry clearance under rule 41. 
United Kingdom<SEP>It was the refusal to alter the birth certificate which led to the decision against Belgium in the Van Oosterwijk case. The Commission could find no compelling reason of public interest which could justify the position of the United Kingdom's government. Furthermore, it found that, although birth certificates were not required by law for any kind of legal transaction in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT>, there could be occasions on which a birth certificate could be called for by, for instance, an employer or public institution. In such circumstances, the refusal of Rees's request constituted in the view of the Commission a violation of his rights guaranteed by Article 8. 
UK<SEP>The distributor Azed Bücher in Basle is setting up a new English-language department, and plans its launch into this area on 1st April. Switzerland's biggest book wholesaler, the Schweizer Buchzentrum, started carrying English titles last year. As well as handling distribution of <ENT>UK<ENT> and US books to Swiss bookshops and department stores Azed will by buying direct for the Azed kiosk chain, which includes the former Kiosk AG and Schmidt-Agence outlets. It is also ready to undertake promotional activities on behalf of the English-publishers it distributes for. 
Belgium<SEP>The facilities, which include a gymnasium and recreation rooms, certainly impressed CCG's Mike Farquharson, who mobilised operations in October of last year. ` The Discovery is a brand new vessel and the facilities are superb. It was built in <ENT>Belgium<ENT> and as a result we were asked to mobilise the ship from the Belgian ports of Zeebrugge and Antwerp. " ` We took a crew across to Belgium plus all our light equipment and bedding for up to 97 people. " 
USA<SEP>Donald Broom, professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge, and Gill Langley, scientific adviser to the Dr Hawden Trust, are two of the better-known in the UK. (Langley is also a member of Animal Aid, an organisation with a radical image opposed to the use of animals in any research, who was unfortunate enough to be beaten up in 1987 by a member of an even more extreme splinter-group.) Martin Stephens and Andrew Rowan are two of many such sympathisers in the <ENT>USA<ENT>; Rowan's Of Mice, Models and Men (1984) being particularly highly regarded. Finally, and most significantly, the public would be seriously worried, whatever the prevailing view in the laboratory, if it were to chink that little of moral significance separated the killing of animals from that of certain groups of human beings such as babies or imbeciles. 
Lebanon<SEP>The Jewish state also offered assurances that deporting Palestinians was not national policy. In a concession made without fanfare, Israeli officials said, they wanted to give the Palestinians a ` face-saving " gesture that should enable them to agree to resume negotiations over self-rule in April. Trying to smooth the festering controversy over Palestinians deported to <ENT>Lebanon<ENT>, the foreign minister, Shimon Peres, said after seeing Mr Christopher that last December's expulsions were ` an exception ". Mr Christopher wants Israel to expedite appeals from Palestinians deported last December on suspicion that they incited anti-Israeli violence. 
France<SEP>AT that means three cars in the space of one. And what's more it's clean. Battery power, especially in <ENT>France<ENT>, means no emissions in urban areas. Its direct-drive 33hp electric motor gives it a good top speed of 74mph and a range of 90 miles: more than enough, says Renault, for the average commuter's entire week's travel.

Britain<SEP>` We have tried to examine our down-side and taken a very prudent view of the problems we might get in the future, " he said. In a surprise move, Whitbread also said it would halt its development of Pizza Hut in France, Belgium and Holland. It plans to sell its franchises in those countries but continue to operate in partnership with Pepsico in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. Mr Jarvis, who spent £40m expanding the chain on the Continent in recent years, said the decision followed Whitbread's inability to negotiate a new exit clause in the franchise agreement which would have given it more protection. 
Togo<SEP>Most of the Africans, apart from Kenyatta, were new names; political unknowns outside their own territories. There were several from the Gold Coast besides Nkrumah, notably Joe Appiah, a barrister and one of the Ashanti aristocracy, and Dr Kurankyi Taylor, another lawyer, a Fanti from the coast: a neighbouring tribe to Nkrumah's Nzima people. Other important Africans present were Wallace Johnson, the trades unionist from Sierra Leone, Peter Abrahams, South African writer, and - one of the few Francophone delegates - the poet Raphael Armattoe from <ENT>Togo<ENT>. The communiqué issued afterwards, like the Bandung communiqué ten years later, was a general statement concerning the Rights of Man. 
Kuwait<SEP>Speaking to MEPs on Jan. 21 Poos declared: " There is a structural weakness in existing political co-operation and it will be up to the intergovernmental conference [ opened in December 1990 - see p. 37905 ] to tackle and reverse that ". He described it as " regrettable " that positions taken in the UN Security Council by the EC's two permanent Security Council members - the UK and France - had not been subject to prior agreement among the 12 EC members. A meeting of Western European Union (WEU) Foreign Ministers in Paris on Jan. 17 reaffirmed support for the USA in the Gulf war and for military action against Iraq until it withdrew unconditionally from <ENT>Kuwait<ENT>. At the meeting both the Netherlands and Italian governments confirmed their commitment to direct military participation in the war. 
Poland<SEP>Further details, including the topics of the seminars, will be made available when the Data quest unit formally announces the conference programme after the CeBit show in Hannover. So far, 19 exhibitors have signed up for the events, including 3Com Corp, Conner Peripherals Inc, Fujitsu Ltd, Quantum Corp, Seagate Technology Corp and Ungermann-Bass Inc. According to Kate Attila, Director of European Conferences, last year the Dataquest conferences attracted 700 visitors to Budapest, 900 to Prague and 500 to <ENT>Poland<ENT>. 
USA<SEP>Traffic segregation: Radburn and Bijlmermeer Of course the influence of Buchanan has not been confined to Western Europe. In the <ENT>USA<ENT> the concept of ` environmental areas " was seen as a powerful reinforcement of the similar ideas contained in Clarence Perry's ` neighbourhood units " and the design of Stein and Wright for Radburn, New Jersey in 1928. Within the ` urban rooms " there are, however, significant differences in the treatment of circulation, with the Radburn design confronting head-on a problem that Buchanan sidestepped. 
Britain<SEP>Another satisfied customer, thought the sales assistant. She could never have suspected that at that very moment, the camera maker's future prosperity hung in the balance. For in a few days, this same man would be reporting back to the most feared woman in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. She is Sue Leggate, editor of the immensely influential Consumers' Association magazine Which? 
South Korea<SEP>That unhinging extended back at least as far as the Japanese attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, a crisis which allowed Franklin Roosevelt finally to break free from the congressional restraints on executive action that had been operative in the inter war period. On this occasion congress exercised its constitutional right to declare war, but, in retrospect, this seems to have been no more than a case of going through the motions - the age of crisis was well underway and the constitutional balance of powers would never be the same again. Just how far things had gone was demonstrated in 1950 when North Korea invaded <ENT>South Korea<ENT>. In a reaction with profound long-term implications President Truman promptly despatched American forces to support South Korea and, on the advice of Dean Acheson, his Secretary of State, deliberately chose not to seek congressional authorization for this act of war. 
France<SEP>Major international affiliations: ECOWAS; NAM; OAU. POLITICAL SYSTEM The Republic of Côte d'Ivoire became fully independent from <ENT>France<ENT> in August 1960, the French version of the name being declared the official version in 1985. Executive power is vested in the President, who is elected for a five-year term. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>In Scotland, these were schools that received part of their maintenance expenditure from the government. They were phased out by 1986. In <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT>, ` grant-aided " is the term equivalent to ` maintained " in Britain. 
Ireland<SEP>The rally, scheduled to take place on Aug. 30, had been organized by church leaders from several denominations to support their demands for greater political freedom and a national referendum on political reform. Earlier in the month, 26 Protestant leaders published an open letter declaring the right of every generation to determine the form of government. One of those detained, Fr Tom Leahy, a Roman Catholic priest from <ENT>Ireland<ENT>, was deported on Aug. 31. On his departure, he accused the government of seeking to delay political reform and urged the church to maintain pressure on the regime of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda. 
Colombia<SEP>The fine things recovered from the royal burials at Ur, from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the dynastic cemeteries of China or the ship-burial of Sutton Hoo were measures not merely of piety but of emulation at the highest level. So intense was this that the Chinese hierarchy, anxious to preserve the established order, found it necessary to restrain competitive display of grave goods by sumptuary regulation. When the Spanish pioneers penetrated the interior of <ENT>Colombia<ENT> during the early sixteenth century they were impressed by what they took to be the passion of the Indians for the well-being of their dead. According to Pedro de Cieza's account of 1554: If Pedro failed to appreciate that the Indians were motivated by emulation as well as by piety in accumulating gold and then sacrificing it in burials, he was well aware of what the practice meant for his fellow countrymen. 
BRITAIN<SEP>ONE OF <ENT>BRITAIN<ENT>'S BEST Artist John Piper, born in 1903, has seen and participated in the major artistic movements and events of this century. 
Australia<SEP>Whitehead Mann has built up an enviable concentration in the top end of the market, attracting some particularly senior and thus highly remunerative assignments. The firm's profits are the subject of some speculation in the business, because of its comparatively small number of employees and relatively modest premises in Welbeck Street. Whitehead Mann has taken on some of the highest salaried job searches in Britain, comparable with Russell Reynolds' recruiting of Bob Bauman for Beecham; an assignment on behalf of a major British company looking for a chief executive to run their operations in <ENT>Australia<ENT> earned the firm £333 000, according to the popular press (on the basis that the successful candidate was to be paid an annual salary approaching £1m.). Dr John Viney, now managing director of Heidrick and Struggles in London, who originally worked at Whitehead Mann, estimated that with modest overheads Mann herself personally bills at least £1m. 
US<SEP>Matters were made worse by the defection of the Harwell scientist Bruno Pontecorvo in September 1950; and later by the escape to Moscow of the British diplomatic defectors Burgess and Maclean in June 1951. It might have been possible for Britain to enforce Anglo-American nuclear collaboration by withholding ore stocks, but to have done so would have reduced American production of fissile material to the Soviets' advantage. Until the RAF was carrying atomic bombs, the First Pillar of British grand strategy - the defence of the United Kingdom - depended upon the <ENT>US<ENT> Strategic Air Command. It would have been foolhardy to risk weakening it at a time when the Cold War was about to turn hot in Korea. 
UK<SEP>Earlier, this obsession had been carried to absurd lengths with the determined pursuit of Sarah Tisdall and Clive Ponting. Whilst other nations wrestle with the complex problems of a modern democracy, the questions of press ownership, the funding of political parties, wire-tapping, privacy, freedom of information, the control of the security services, and so on, Britain has been content either to stand aside altogether or to legislate for continuing trust and deference. A special report on censorship in the <ENT>UK<ENT> by the New York Times magazine in March 1989 was headed simply, ` Thatcher puts a lid on ". Puzzlement outside the country has been matched by even greater anxiety within it. 
India<SEP>Conversation was more difficult than one might have expected. They exchanged some fragments of personal news. Fleury told the Collector that his brother-in-law, General Dunstaple, who had married Miss Hughes that was, still lived in <ENT>India<ENT> and was currently, according to their most recent mail, shooting tigers in Nepal. His own sister, Miriam, the Collector probably did not know, had subsequently married Dr McNab and they, too, had remained in India. 
North America<SEP>So, I'll start with the book businesses. Book sales show a, a nice increase in er, in sales revenue, especially in the U K, which is up seventeen percent overall. Penguin U K is gaining sale and market share and in <ENT>North America<ENT> the sales are only slightly down on last year, which was a very exceptional year anyway. Longman did particularly well in the U K, although coeternal markets were difficult and er, sales in the schools markets in er, North America was hard going for Addison Wesley, with U S physical problems restricting the, amou money that schools had to er, had to use. 
Britain<SEP>Clean air and defence are examples of public goods. If the air is pollution-free, your consumption of it does not interfere with our consumption of it. If the Royal Navy is patrolling <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s coastal waters, your consumption of national defence does not affect our quantity of national defence. In fact, for a pure public good we must all necessarily consume the same quantity, namely, whatever quantity is supplied in the aggregate. 
South Georgia<SEP>The upper house (House of Lords) is appointed on a partly hereditary and partly non-hereditary (life) basis and includes certain senior judges and 26 Church of England bishops; it currently comprises some 1,200 members. The government is formed by the political party with majority support in the House of Commons; legislation requires approval by both houses before enactment. The UK also includes the Crown Dependencies of the isle of Man and the Channel Islands, and is responsible for the British Dependent Territories of Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, St Helena and Dependencies, <ENT>South Georgia<ENT> and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands [ see also pp. 38239-41; 38246; 3 ]. Main government leaders 
Australia<SEP>hoping to go to to Australia. <ENT>Australia<ENT>, through in 
West Germany<SEP>(1978) and Marsh et al. (1981). Marsh's study of the engineering industry in Britain and <ENT>West Germany<ENT> adopts the standpoint that, whatever the form which industrial relations takes, similar topics for regulation will appear, thus providing a basis for comparison. The structures and activities involved in regulating relations at workplace level, such as wage payment systems, employee hiring and work discipline are then compared, subject-by-subject, for five engineering plants in each country. 
Spain<SEP>Farm director Lyn Powell explained that the original intention was not to produce yet another crossbred ewe to compete with Mules and other well established halfbreds, but to explore the possibility of producing fine-woolled wethers to graze moorland and rough grazings that would never be improved because of environmental pressures. The French breed used hailed from north-east France. Its wool was not as fine as that of Merinos from <ENT>Spain<ENT>, or the southern hemisphere, but it was noted for its hardiness and foraging ability. Ewes weighed between 70 and 90kg and produced fleeces weighing up to 6.5kg. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>Clinton's second allegation, that there has been collusion between the security forces and Protestant para-military groups, is based on a very few isolated cases in which part-time members of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) have been found guilty of passing on sensitive information. Such actions are entirely reprehensible. But, in a highly polarised society such as <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT>, some cases are inevitable. There is no evidence to suggest it is widespread. 
UK<SEP>In the <ENT>UK<ENT>, Cambridge-based CadCentre's GNC Plus is to support Hewlett-Packard's 9000 series 700 workstations: GNC Plus, its Unix Cam package it allows CAD-generated component designs to be turned directly into machining programs for NC/CNC tools. 
France<SEP>Following the Rodin fakes scandal, French bronze founders act to protect their good name PARIS. Shocked by recent scandals involving fake Giacometti and Rodin works (see The Art Newspaper No. 14, January 1992, p. 1 and No. 17, April 1992, p. 1) and alarmed by the discredit being heaped on their profession, <ENT>France<ENT>'s fourteen leading bronze founders have met in Paris under the auspices of their professional union, the Syndicat Général de Fondeurs de France, to discuss means of combating forgery. The Syndicat concluded that French legislation is incomplete in its definitions of reproductions and forgery. 
UK<SEP>Arguably, the most valuable material is in the remaining three chapters where the authors discuss a European emphasis on preventive and social action which is less apparent here. For example, they show how French governments in the 1980s challenged social workers to work with others to prevent crime, delinquency and exclusion. In the <ENT>UK<ENT>, the term ` social action " has almost disappeared from social work. But elsewhere in Europe it lives on and refers to new ways of working with groups, especially those on the margins. 
Vietnam<SEP>" Celebrations " were organized by the Chinese authorities in May 1991 on the 40th anniversary of the " liberation " of Tibet. Large numbers of Chinese troops were stationed in Lhasa to prevent any pro-independence demonstrations. Other major foreign policy events of 1990 included the renewal or establishment of diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Singapore and an improvement in ties with <ENT>Vietnam<ENT> and South Korea. Chinese and South Korean officials agreed in October 1990 to establish trade offices in Beijing and Seoul. 
The Netherlands<SEP>This is illustrated by Lijphart's (1984, 1989) analyses of types of democratic political systems, which was initially based on two dimensions reflecting different aspects of majoritarian and consensual rule. Fitting different political systems into this schema empirically involved defining the dimensions on the following variables. For the first dimension, five used were: whether executive power is concentrated (as in the British Cabinet) or shared (as in the Swiss Federal Council, in which all parties are represented); whether the executive dominates (as in the UK), or shares power with the legislature (as in the United States); whether there is a two or a multi-party system; whether parties are divided on one political dimension (e.g. the typical left-right division in Great Britain) or several (as in <ENT>The Netherlands<ENT>); and whether elections use plurality or proportional representation procedures. Together these measured the majoritarian-consensual dimension. 
Bulgaria<SEP>Bulgaria unilaterally suspended repayment of debt principal to commercial bank creditors on March 29, 1990, and early in April requested negotiations on a repayments moratorium and new lines of credit while reforms were enacted. On June 30 interest payments were also suspended. An application for membership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank was filed on Feb. 23, and <ENT>Bulgaria<ENT> became a member of the IMF on Sept. 25. Environment 
Romania<SEP>South Africa and Bulgaria forged new diplomatic links at the end of November, and Foreign Minister R. F. " Pik " Botha predicted restoration of full diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union within six months. (South Africa had offered assistance to the Soviet Union in the resettlement of victims of the Chernobyl disaster.) Reporting on Nov. 21 on the results of his week-long tour of Eastern Europe from which he had just returned, Botha noted the establishment of consular ties with Czechoslovakia and <ENT>Romania<ENT>. Botha visited the Comoros, Kenya and Zambia during December, while South African Airways began scheduled flights to Nairobi. 
United Kingdom<SEP>The coalmining industry was one of the first to be nationalized. In addition, the coalminers, through their trades unions, have long been major actors in the political arena those of both the workplace (notably the Trades Union Congress) and the state (the Labour party). Strike action on the coalfields was the major catalyst for the 1926 General Strike, and the miners have been widely perceived for several decades as at the forefront of trade union militancy in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT>. The strike itself has been the subject of a great deal of analysis: by participants, e.g. Barnsley WAPC (1984), MacGregor (1986), People of Thurcroft (1986); by journalists and other commentators, e.g. Adeney and Lloyd (1986), Crick (1985), Goodman (1985); and by academics, e.g. Beynon (1985), Fine and Millar (1985), Samuel, Bloomfield and Boanas (1986), Winterton and Winterton (1989). 
Panama<SEP>After some uneventful voyages over the years, and at least seven previous masters, the Orynthia seemed to have turned into a hornets' nest. There was nothing to do but carry on, severely reduced in numbers as they were, and without a ship's cook. They set off along the coast of Venezuela and Colombia, south to <ENT>Panama<ENT>, past Costa Rica and Nicaragua, until finally they reached Honduras, their intended destination. 38. 
Cameroon<SEP>It was this example that the AfDB had in mind when, in 1990, it turned down the Cameroon road project. Now it appears that Paul Biya, Cameroon's president, head of state and party chairman, has - in the words of a recent article in Japan's Daily Yomiuri - ` decided to do what most of the world's poorer nations do when they need ready cash, and approached [ Japan's ] Foreign Affairs Ministry. " The trans-Cameroon road, if built, ` would jeopardise a vast expanse of <ENT>Cameroon<ENT>'s rainforest and [ those ] who live there, " says the World Bank. The bank has abandoned all plans to finance roads or logging in Cameroon's forests, in keeping with its ` stringent policy to protect the rights of indigenous people. " 
UK<SEP>Where does this leave conservation in 1985? Energy conservation has changed. In the first instance it was exemplified in the title of the campaign introduced in the <ENT>UK<ENT> in 1977 called ` Save It ". The emphasis was on using less. 
Switzerland<SEP>Capsaicin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was dissolved in absolute ethanol, followed by addition of Tween 80 and saline, the final concentration being 12.5 mg/ ml capsaicin in 10% ethanol, 10% Tween 80, and 80% saline (vol/vol/vol). The vehicle solution was prepared in the same manner. Phenobarbital sodium (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was dissolved in physiological saline (33 mg/ml), whereas urethane (Fluka, Buchs, <ENT>Switzerland<ENT>) was dissolved in water (25%, wt/wt). 
Chile<SEP>CHILE Aylwin's US visit President Patricio Aylwin Azócar was told by US President Bush on May 14, during his first official visit to the USA since taking office in March 1990, that <ENT>Chile<ENT> would be the next country with which the US would negotiate a free trade agreement, after the completion of talks between the USA, Mexico and Canada to establish a North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA - see p. 38761). A NAFTA agreement was not expected until after the November 1992 US presidential elections. 
USA<SEP>Postgraduate numbers: 24 research The department undertakes highly focused research addressing the current needs of industry. Current collaborative research and close contacts exist with many other universities in Britain, <ENT>USA<ENT>, Canada, Australia, PR China, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, and Austria. The department has 10 laboratories for Structural Testing, Concrete Technology, Hydraulics, Geotechnical Engineering, Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Studies, Stress Analysis, Computing, Non-destructive Testing, Pollution Control, and Fire Safety Engineering. 
Israel<SEP>This can be welcome neither to the Jordanian regime nor to themselves. Such factors are to do with where the refugees currently find themselves, not with the urge to return to Palestine. This urge is not merely the nostalgic ` village patriotism " of a dwindling breed who remember Palestine before 1948, as is widely believed in <ENT>Israel<ENT>. It is a yearning for Palestine which permeates the whole refugee community and is most ardently espoused by the younger refugees, for whom home exists only in the imagination. 
Italy<SEP>The duo from the CIS are Alexander Popov, the 100 metre freestyle champion, and Gennadi Progoda, who won the silver medal when finishing one place ahead of Fibbens in the 50m freestyle. This year's meet incorporates the super final of the Uncle Ben's Rice British Grand Prix series where Fibbens, the reigning sprint freestyle champion, is just one of nine defending champions. CYCLING: David Cook (Darlington) and Simeon Hempsall (Sheffield), the 1989 and 1990 national amateur road race champions who are both now based with French clubs, have been called into Britain's team for the Grand Prix Liberazione one-day event and the Giro Regioni stage race in <ENT>Italy<ENT> from April 25 to May 1. SPEEDWAY: Joe Screen, who won the British under-21 championship in 1990, will start favourite for this year's title as he chases a £10,000 bonus from sponsors Homefire. 
China<SEP>The Versailles peace conference acceded to Japan's takeover of the former German concessions, but the Chinese refused to sign any treaty which did not return them to China, and Japan remained in occupation. At the 1921-2 Washington Conference Japan agreed to restore Chinese sovereignty in Shandong, but only in return for Chinese confirmation of Japan's economic privileges there. In the years after the Twenty-One Demands Japanese governments tended to adopt a more indirect approach in their attempts to exert Japanese influence in <ENT>China<ENT>. In 1917-18, for example, a massive sum in politically-motivated loans found its way from Japan to China, nominally for industrial and infrastructural development, but in fact ending up as political and military funding. 
Germany<SEP>Reflecting Germany's special relationship with Israel German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher visited the country on Jan. 24-25, bringing with him a promise to provide DM250,000,000 in humanitarian aid. On Jan. 30 the government also announced that it was sending to Israel eight launchers for Patriot missiles (equipped to deter aircraft rather than Scud missiles), eight " sniffer " vehicles for chemical warfare detection, 50 similar vehicles from the former East German army and a commitment to provide two submarines subject to approval by the relevant parliamentary committees. Opposition to the war and especially to the role of the USA was particularly strong in <ENT>Germany<ENT>. Protesters included many school and university students. 
Guyana<SEP>Major international affiliations: ACP; Amazon Pact; CARICOM; Geplacea; NAM; OAS (full membership January 1991); SELA. POLITICAL SYSTEM A member of the Commonwealth, <ENT>Guyana<ENT> gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 and became a republic in 1970. Under the 1980 Constitution an executive President is elected every five years with the 65-member unicameral National Assembly (of which 53 members are directly elected by proportional representation and 12 are regional representatives). 
Georgia<SEP>Americans Buy Bonded Machines After five months of modifications, overhauling and a complete refurbishment by Stoddard's own engineers and tuners, the latest Bonded Machine is on it's way to the Wellco Corporation in <ENT>Georgia<ENT>. Once it arrives in America, a team of experts from Stoddards will set it up and help to train the new operatives. 
Australia<SEP>NAURU Death of DeRoburt - Ruling on compensation claim A state of mourning was declared in Nauru following the death of former President Hammer DeRoburt on July 15 in Melbourne, <ENT>Australia<ENT>. A state funeral was held on July 22. 
Estonia<SEP>The Baltic Council (comprising Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, first formed in 1934 and revived in May 1990-see p. 37462) sought to develop economic ties with the Nordic Council (founded in the early 1950s and comprising Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). At a meeting in Tallinn, Estonia, the three Baltic Prime Ministers requested assistance from the Nordic Council in the establishment of a Baltic investment bank. <ENT>Estonia<ENT>, Latvia and Lithuania joined the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) on joining the UN in September 1991 [ see p. 38419; for Israeli accession in mid-1991 see p. 38367 ]. Eureka research programme 
Poland<SEP>This set me thinking on the themes that are expressed in this book. Though I thought the above observation worthy of a mini-publication, it might be said that it was not all that surprising. We have long known, of course, that the White Chalk facies of late Cretaceous times extended all the way from Antrim in Northern Ireland, via England and northern France, through the Low Countries, northern Germany and southern Scandinavia to <ENT>Poland<ENT>, Bulgaria and eventually to Georgia in the south of the Soviet Union. We also knew of the same facies in Egypt and Israel. 
USA<SEP>On the other hand, there is no law saying that librarianship, or teaching, or media production, can not be learned at professional level by people who already have a professional accreditation in another field. This is an assumption or misunderstanding that can only have arisen from the curious vagaries of the student grants system in Britain. In the <ENT>USA<ENT>, with its flexible and adaptable system of higher education and its tradition of easy access to university summer courses, it is common to meet teachers who have, over a period of time, gained professional competence in each field and become fully professional in every sense, able to talk on terms of complete parity with professional colleagues in each group. This situation would (as we shall see) be very desirable in the UK; some librarians, some teachers and some media specialists have painstakingly and at much personal cost gained dual or multiple status, and the extension of this practice would go far towards resolving unnecessary antagonisms between professional interest groups. 
United Kingdom<SEP>These articles, so far as relevant, provide: ` Special jurisdiction. 5. A person domiciled in a part of the United Kingdom may, in another part of the United Kingdom, be sued: (1) in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question; [hellip] (3) in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or in the case of a threatened wrong is likely to occur; [hellip] (8) in proceedings - (a) concerning a debt secured on immovable property; or (b) which are brought to assert, declare or determine proprietary or possessory rights, or rights of security, in or over movable property, or to obtain authority to dispose of movable property, in the courts of the part of the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> in which the property is situated. ` 6.

Switzerland<SEP>DISCIPLESHIP TRAINING SCHOOL REPORT GARY KILPATRICK On 1 January 1992 I finally flew out of Glasgow Airport to begin my Discipleship Training School (DTS) with Youth with a Mission (YWAM) in Lausanne, <ENT>Switzerland<ENT>. The school would span five months split into two phases, a three-month lecture phase and a two-month outreach. 
Surinam<SEP>On Dec. 21 the UN General Assembly approved Sadako Ogata, a Japanese professor of international relations and a member of the UN Human Rights Commission, as the new High Commissioner for Refugees [ see p. 37931 ]. In March an internal UN inquiry had cleared Jean-Pierre Hocké who resigned as High Commissioner in October 1989 [ see p. 36989 ], of all charges relating to the misappropriation of funds [ see p. 37888 ]. During 1990 the UNHCR concluded a number of agreements with individual governments on the repatriation and resettlement of refugees, including an agreement with the government of Hong Kong concerning the repatriation of Vietnamese " boat-people " [ see pp. 37319; 37714 ], and one with the government of Surinam on the repatriation of 1,000 <ENT>Surinam<ENT> refugees from French Guiana [ see p. 37494 ]. Relief operations in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait [ see pp. 37631-41; 37697; 37988 ] were considered to be only marginally the concern of the UNHCR, being seen primarily as the evacuation of third-party nationals to their home countries, rather than the repatriation of refugees. 
US<SEP>The Clayton Aniline Company (CAC), which is part of the Ciba-Geigy in the UK, has existed on its present site in East Manchester for the past 116 years. The company was founded by the French chemist Charles Dreyfus in 1876 for the production of aniline oil and aniline salt. Within only a few years the company was exporting its products to central Europe, Russia and the <ENT>US<ENT> . Manchester provided a good site for developing a dye industry because it was both at the heart of the Lancashire textile industry and it was close to a developing university.
West Germany<SEP>Indeed, one can only wonder that a deep, profoundly intelligent and inherently human European culture is retreating to the background before the primitive revelry of violence and pornography and the flow of cheap feelings and low thoughts. If this is what the Common European Home stands for, so enthusiastically embraced by the Germans on the occasion of Gorbachev's visit to Bonn in June 1989, then it is difficult to think of a more decisive rejection of the values of the Atlantic alliance. It is certainly a long way from the crowds cheering at John F. Kennedy's ` Ich bin ein Berliner " speech in front of the Berlin Wall in 1962 to the communiqué issued after Honecker's visit to <ENT>West Germany<ENT> in 1987: ` both states agreed to respect the sovereignty and independence of each other in both domestic and foreign matters ". Part of the attraction for Gorbachev was, no doubt, that he was viewed as bringing peace. 
Pakistan<SEP>This has brought Islam once again into direct confrontation with the British school system. Most of the Pakistani mothers I asked were against sex education in school. Rifat, a woman in her late thirties with an urban background in <ENT>Pakistan<ENT>, told me: I don't think they should learn about these things at such an early age. 
France<SEP>Todd's interest in family structures was part of his search for an explanation of ` the distribution of political ideologies, systems and forces on our planet " (p. 1), which political science had significantly failed to provide. He suggested that each family type is linked to particular ideology. As an example, he contends that ` communism is a transference to the party state of the moral traits and the regulatory mechanisms of the exogamous community family " (p. 33), so that the electoral success of communist parties had occurred only in areas dominated by that family type, whereas in <ENT>France<ENT> ` Socialism [hellip] follows on quite naturally from Catholicism " (p. 86). In a later work, Todd (1987) linked aspects of family structure to another variable - literacy - which is closely associated with economic and social development: the more literate societies are the more developed. 
Spain<SEP>To concentrate on new legislation or the statutory repealing of the old is, however, to miss the point. What really counted was the attitude of government to the implementation and observance of legislation, especially at local level, and here it is clear that from the moment the Radical leader, Lerroux, first assumed the premiership in September 1933 a dramatic reaction set in. During 1934 the advantage in rural <ENT>Spain<ENT> was allowed to swing violently back to landowners, landlords and employers, many of whom seized every opportunity to reverse by means of sackings, wage-cuts and evictions labour's modest gains of the previous two-and-a-half years. Lerroux, believing that the pendulum had swung too far left in 1931-3, was now hoping to draw irreversibly into the Republican fold the conservative forces largely represented by the CEDA. 
United States<SEP>A Caribbean branch was opened in New York in 1928. However, it was only in 1929 that a separate Secretariat for Latin America was formed within the Comintern's Moscow administration; hitherto relations with Latin American Communist parties had been handled through a ` Latin Secretariat " which also covered Southern Europe. The potential role of Latin America in any conflict between the <ENT>United States<ENT> and Great Britain had become a main concern of Comintern policy by 1928, when its Sixth Congress was held. For the first time, Latin America was significantly represented and its revolutionary potential discussed, a development also partly attributable to events in Nicaragua where Augusto Sandino was raising a nationalist banner to challenge US imperialism. 
Panama<SEP>In a script worthy of an Oliver Stone conspiracy movie, officials of the government trying permanently to corner Noriega emerged to give the accused his best character evidence. A former chief of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, an organisation regarded as a firm enemy of Noriega, swore to tell the whole truth and proceeded to laud Noriega for his ` long-standing support " and ` personal commitment " to the drug wars. The US prosecutors painted the accused as ` a crooked cop ", co-operating for $4.6 million (£2.6 million) with the Medellin cocaine cartel by shielding US-bound drug shipments as they moved through <ENT>Panama<ENT>. But Mr Bush's old agency, the CIA, suddenly produced the trial's only real, live agent to blow apart a key assertion: that Noriega had fallen out with the cartel after his troops destroyed a state-of-the-art cocaine laboratory in Panama. 
Slovenia<SEP>Deputy Prime Minister Zivko Pregl said on Jan. 21 that the outcome of the congress would not affect the government's plans to press ahead with legislation to change the federal Constitution and create the conditions for a multiparty system, and he observed that the LCY in future " will be relevant to the extent that it succeeds in elections which will be direct and secret ". Scheduling of multiparty elections in Slovenia and Croatia - Proliferation of opposition parties Multiparty elections to the republican Assemblies were scheduled to take place in <ENT>Slovenia<ENT> and Croatia in April 1990, the Slovene and Croatian LCs having given their endorsement at congresses in December 1989. In both Slovenia and Croatia there had been a proliferation of new political parties in the past year. 
New Guinea<SEP>All Allied regular forces had been withdrawn from Java and Sumatra, but guerrilla operations continued in Portuguese eastern Timor until early in 1943. Here the neutral Portuguese were prevented from reinforcing their garrison by Japanese command of the sea and air. During March, the Japanese landed on the north coast of <ENT>New Guinea<ENT>, an island of high mountains and jungle twice the size of the British Isles. Over confident after their quick victories, the Japanese began an invasion of the Solomons and planned a landing at Port Moresby in south-east New Guinea. 
America<SEP>And because Duke of York became the rhyming slang for ` fork ", people wishing to be engaged in fisticuffs began telling their opponents to ` put up their dukes ". In America the belligerent are said to be ` on the prod ", a reference to the cowboy employed in the stockyards to move cattle along with a pole tipped by a metal goad. From farther north in <ENT>America<ENT> comes the more familiar ` to have a chip on your shoulder " which was born in the logging camps. Any lumberjack who was feeling sufficiently ill-disposed towards his fellow drinking companions could place on his shoulder a small chip of wood to indicate he would take on any man who cared to flick it off. 
Paraguay<SEP>Average heights are 148cm in the bull and 137cm in the cow, and weights 1,100-1,200kg and 800-900kg, respectively, but both are being increased. There is also a polled Charolais, generally bred to be lighter boned than the traditional type, and some breeders used the Lincoln Red to introduce the polling factor. This massive, muscular breed is now known all over the world and over the last quarter of a century it has seen herdbooks or breed societies established in 24 countries in addition to France (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, <ENT>Paraguay<ENT>, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the UK, the USSR, the USA, Uruguay and Zimbabwe). Its main role is as a terminal sire for suckler herds or as a beef sire for dairy herds. 
Kenya<SEP>KENYA Banning of political rallies On March 19 the government banned all political meetings indefinitely after weeks of serious violence in western <ENT>Kenya<ENT>. Earlier in the month there had been rioting in Nairobi. 
Britain<SEP>Prices in Greece and Portugal are also up to 40 per cent lower than in the rest of Europe. High-price, low-bulk pharmaceuticals are ideal for moving from cheap to expensive markets and, under Commmunity rules, manufacturers are powerless to intervene. Mr Lumley said parallel trade had become so great that eight in 10 High Street chemists in Britain regularly dispensed drugs made in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, exported to France, say, and re-imported for sale to NHS patients. Parallel trade is now so well established that Health Department payments to pharmacists can be clawed back for sales of discounted drugs. 
United States<SEP>The ` White Alps " are disappearing. The Cornish china clay (or kaolin) occurs in primary deposits. In the <ENT>United States<ENT>, Australia and other parts of the world, deposits are secondary and are mined with much less disturbance by digging them from the sites to which natural processes have moved them. Such landscapes can be restored more easily than those in Cornwall. 
Poland<SEP>Hitler's instruction to curb anti-Polish activity meant that what they could not accomplish by open violence or legalistic chicanery they would have to accomplish by stealth and skulduggery. The odd balance of power within the city was almost destroyed entirely when on 12 November 1933 Adolf Hitler announced that Germany was leaving the League of Nations. Only his swift conclusion of a non-aggression pact with Poland saved Danzig from a final resolution of the city's problems in <ENT>Poland<ENT>'s favour. During 1934 the tensions within the Danzig NSDAP were most evident in the hostility between Gauleiter Forster and Senate President Hermann Rauschning. 
Korea<SEP>General Hodge reported that the reopening of the Joint Commission was a disappointment for Rhee and the extreme right in that they had campaigned vociferously for the past year against further American-Soviet discussion. The Joint Commission soon became bogged down in renewed argument over the eligibility of various groups for consultation, with the Russians reiterating refusal to consult rightists currently denouncing the Soviet Union vehemently and demonstrating noisily in Seoul. On 23 June rightist demonstrations took place in Seoul and in other parts of south <ENT>Korea<ENT>; Hodge ordered American tanks on to the streets to disperse the crowds. The exchanges in the Joint Commission again ended in deadlock and this marked the termination of the discussions set in train at the Moscow conference.

Israel<SEP>Now, from reports that have come out of Baghdad, it does sound as though there is a great deal of accuracy on erm the targets, but we don't know yet exactly what's been going on. So what do you think about the overall situation as it stands at the present time? And in particular, have you any thoughts on the overnight attack on Israel, the seven missiles which were fired at <ENT>Israel<ENT>, what effects do you think this is going to have on the conflict? And do you expect Israel to attack, and if they do attack, or retaliate, then will this change the whole complexion of the conflict? 
Pakistan<SEP>As a young man, David Gower prophesied that he would be England captain by the age of 25. He made it, too, taking over against Pakistan in 1982 for one match when Willis was injured - and, given the most toothless of bowling attacks, losing heavily. In <ENT>Pakistan<ENT> in 1983-4 he took over again when Willis had to return home sick and gained two creditable draws, after which he was officially appointed to lead England against the West Indies in 1984, at the age of 27. With the easy grace and dignity associated with the old amateur tradition there was never any doubt that the job would come to him, and so gifted was he as a batsman that one somehow assumed he would slip easily into it once he had learned the ropes. 
Djibouti<SEP>Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea radio announced from Asmara on Sept. 26 that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was to send observers to Eritrea for the planned referendum on independence in April 1993 [ see p. 38855 ]. Hijacking Two men and a woman armed with grenades hijacked an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 727 airliner on a flight from Dire Dawa in eastern Ethiopia to Addis Ababa, the capital, on Sept. 4 and forced the pilot to land in <ENT>Djibouti<ENT> [ for Aug. 28 hijacking see p. 39042 ]. The 50 passengers were released, but the hijackers held four crew members hostage for several hours during negotiations with the Djibouti authorities and Ethiopian embassy officials. 
Indonesia<SEP>A joint communiqué signed at the UN in New York by the Singaporean Foreign Affairs and Community Development Minister, Wong Kan Seng, and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, stated that the two governments had decided to establish diplomatic relations " on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the UN ". An agreement to establish relations " as early as possible " had been reached during an Aug. 11-13 visit to Singapore by the Chinese Premier Li Peng [ see p. 37656 ]. The impetus for this agreement had been provided on Aug. 8 by the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and <ENT>Indonesia<ENT>, one of Singapore's five partners in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) [ see pp. 37612-13; 37656 ]. Brunei was now the sole ASEAN member without formal diplomatic ties with China. 
Britain<SEP>With the possible exception of the towns of Bremen and Hamburg and the ` Free State " of Bavaria, where strong regional loyalties are important, Germany is a thoroughly homogeneous nation-state (before the annexation of the five new Länder, at least). The concept of co-operative federalism is more a convenient myth for the gravy train of the Länder bureaucracies than anything to do with popular sentiment. Elections to the Länder governments are treated much like by-elections in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, as a way of expressing a mid-term opinion of the Federal Government, rather than as a way of choosing a significantly different local or regional government. ` The federal arrangements of the German Basic Law have less to do with real federative forces than with the principle of the separation of powers itself, and they benefit party political groups, their ability to form alliances and the bureaucracy. " 
Switzerland<SEP>On the other hand, the most important person, the cameraman, wore jeans and a Micky Mouse T-shirt, over which his mournful, deadpan moon face shone incongruously. Jane had the opportunity - or rather, misfortune - of an adman's view of two foreign countries. The first was <ENT>Switzerland<ENT>: safe Switzerland, protected by mountains and international banking. The scenery was beautiful, but it had not entered into the soul of the people. 
United Kingdom<SEP>Guinness Enterprises At the Gleneagles Hotel, work on the new Jack Nicklaus designed Monarch championship golf course is nearing completion, ready for the official tee off in May 1993. The specially designed Gleneagles Suite conference facility has been completed - one of the most sophisticated hotel conference facilities in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT>. At Guinness Publishing, the other Guinness Enterprises company, the ever-popular Guinness Book of Records has maintained its position as the world's best-selling copyright book. 
UK<SEP>Nevertheless it is probably still the most effective selection tool for new books, because of its comprehensiveness and the detail of its content. The matter of timeliness is discussed, in relation to the selection decision for new books, in Chapter 8. An important factor here is the <ENT>UK<ENT> Cataloguing-in-Publication programme (CIP), which provides pre-publication information for a large proportion of the new titles. A 1985 survey by Bishop and Lewis threw some light on the way that BNB was actually used in UK libraries. 
UK<SEP>Although the size variation puts them in slightly different markets, they are practical family cars that are easy to drive and fun, too. Fuel consumption is good, especially from the larger BMW that's said to cost about half as much to run as the old 5-series. In the <ENT>UK<ENT>, more than one in 30 new cars is now either a BMW or a Mercedes. If you get behind the wheel of one of these, you'll know why. 
France<SEP>He was determined to win where Fisher had failed and his members came first. I saw no prospect of any sensible compromise. In mid-August I made the great mistake of seeking a four-day break from London to stay with friends in <ENT>France<ENT>. That was roundly attacked in the press and particularly the health press, even though I left Ken Clarke in charge. 
US<SEP>These circumstances are themselves historically changing, and in response to the changes new social movements and parties may emerge within the established political system, as did the socialist parties, and later the communist and fascist parties, in Europe. The success or failure of such third parties, or more generally of new parties, is affected by many social factors, as well as by the political system itself, including the electoral system. In the <ENT>US<ENT>, for example, where the socialist party failed to establish itself as a major party after a fairly rapid growth in the first decade of this century, it has long been argued that the presidential system is a major obstacle to the development of third parties, and undoubtedly these constitutional factors have been important; but it is clear that many other social and economic characteristics of the US have had a preponderant influence in determining the absence of a large-scale independent socialist movement or party there (Sombart, 1906; Laslett and Lipset, 1974). In some European countries with a two-party system, in which the parties have traditionally been closely associated with the major classes in capitalist society, changes in the class structure - such as were examined in Chapter 1 - have made possible the emergence or revival of ` centre " parties, and changes of this kind may in due course have an impact upon the electoral system itself. 
Philippines<SEP>Habitat: <ENT>Philippines<ENT>, Malaysia. 
Spain<SEP>The celebrated pilgrim guide of the early twelfth century makes even Vézelay a step on the road to St James at Compostela in north-west Spain. Try the Madeleine (Magdalene) at Vézelay on your way, says the author, ` for her love, faults are forgiven, the blind see, the dumb speak, the lame walk "; try St Léonard at Noblat who releases captives; try Saint-Gilles, ` speediest of all the saints to help the unfortunate and the afflicted ". Word went round in the seventh century that St James the Apostle had visited <ENT>Spain<ENT>, and in the early ninth century a bishop of Padron discovered what he took to be his body. To the shrine came a trickle of pilgrims, which by the eleventh and twelfth centuries was growing into a flood.

USA<SEP>What follows will be an attempt to examine sport in both of these differing lights. The attempt is structured in terms of an historical overview of blacks' attachments to sport, starting the analysis in the eighteenth century and seeking to document the social sources behind the enduring link. The chapter sets the tenor for the whole work in so far as it tries to examine the social conditions under which blacks became involved in sport, first in the <ENT>USA<ENT> and then in Great Britain. My contention is that no account of the emergence of black sportsmen in contemporary Britain can ignore the social and historical circumstances in which that emergence occurred. 
UK<SEP>Environmental Politics <ENT>UK<ENT> Environment Secretary calls for change The UK Environment Secretary, John Gummer, has launched a consultation paper on how the country might move towards sustainability as envisaged at the Rio summit. 
Britain<SEP>Tail and wing-tip trolleys <ENT>Britain<ENT> must be one of the only countries in the world where the club members manhandle the two-seater gliders all the way out to the launch point. Most private owners discovered the use of a tail and wing-tip dolly a long time ago, making it possible to tow out with a car single-handedly on most days. 
New Zealand<SEP>Such secondary pulses have been observed at about this time of year after very strong El Ninos in 1957, 1956 and 1972 - but this 1982 ` secondary " would have been stronger than the ` primary " it belongs to, again raising the question ` why? " But while the exact timing of this pattern of events was unusual, the return of the overall pattern in the early 1980s comes as little surprise to some researchers, who have been warning for several years that a new drought cycle was due. R. G. Vines, of CSIRO in Melbourne, is among the theorists who have analysed rainfall patterns over South Africa, Australia and <ENT>New Zealand<ENT> and found evidence of cyclic patterns including recurring severe droughts at roughly 20-year intervals. Such claims are always contentious in climatic circles, and opponents of the work claim that the cycles are not statistically significant, and criticise Vines's claim that the patterns correlate with changes in the Sun's activity. 
Britain<SEP>Record price for clock AN antiques dealer, who banks with Knutsford Branch, has set a British auction record by paying £26,800 for an English long case clock with a painted dial. Roy Clements wanted it for his collection which is thought to be the largest in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. Englishman Robert Hynam made the clock for the Russian Court at St Petersburg in 1760. 
Britain<SEP>How do we explain the growth of nationalism, and ethnic claims for autonomy and self-determination, not least those currently taking place within the Soviet Union? As Smith points out, ` ethnic ties and national loyalties have become more deep rooted than ever ". The postwar period has seen a great rise in ethnicity; starting in the 1950s with areas peripheral to France and Spain and continuing in the 1960s with <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s ` Celtic Fringe ". The 1980s have seen ethnicity and nationalism escalating in scope; not only within the Soviet Union but in Eastern Europe and a wide range of Third World societies. 
Latvia<SEP>LATVIA New currency - Coup investigation report From July 20 the Latvian rouble was officially the only legal tender in <ENT>Latvia<ENT> when the Russian rouble became a foreign currency. Introduced in May as an interim currency to overcome the cash shortage [ see p. 38926 ], the Latvian rouble had the same value as the Russian. 
France<SEP>In Japan the first railway line between Yokohama and Tokyo (18 miles) was opened in 1872, and within thirty Years there were 3,000 miles of track. The newly restored Japanese Emperor opened the line, and thereby scotched the bitter religious opposition that had been aroused against the building of railways. But whereas Chinese railways became a prey to concession seekers, railway builders, and engineers from Britain, <ENT>France<ENT>, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Japan, and the United States, even Portugal, Austria, and Italy, the Japanese tried to keep railway-building, after an initial concessionary period, firmly in their own hands. The first Chinese station was destroyed in 1876. 
UK<SEP>However, this is offset by the demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology. Rhind's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the Brundtland report. It points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the <ENT>UK<ENT> economy. This contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the European Community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these efforts. 
Belgium<SEP>If only the Government had concentrated more resources on the development of clean coal generators, we would not be light years behind the United States, Japan and other coal-producing countries in Europe. They profess wholehearted support for clean coal technology, but, by forcing British Coal to search for private sector money, the potentially world-beating topping cycle developments at Grimethorpe have been delayed and delayed. Why is it that the first and second phases of planned underground gasification demonstration plants are to be made in Spain and <ENT>Belgium<ENT>? It is because those Governments have been arguing for coal utilisation while our Government have sat on their hands wanting to take a swipe at miners and their communities. 
India<SEP>In Australia the absence of population in the great central deserts ensured that the stations were built more for the benefit of the trains than for the nonexistent passengers and goods. On the other hand, on the Trans-Caspian and Trans-Siberian lines the scale of the enterprise was such that the stations became in effect complete communities dominating their localities as part of the process of conquering those vast outer regions of the Russian Empire. The British built grandly in many places in <ENT>India<ENT>, partly to celebrate their own power, but also because the scale of the population, the high degree of urbanization, and the economic potential of the railways demanded it. On smaller-scale railways, in Ceylon, South-East Asia, and West Africa, the richness and diversity of railway architecture was truly striking.

US<SEP>Measured by value added or employment, Japanese investment is modest. The surge in foreign acquisitions of US firms since 1986 is attributed to the fall in the dollar, and to the reform of corporation tax in the same year. Between 1981-6, corporate tax rates were much harsher on US affiliates of foreign owned firms, who found their low <ENT>US<ENT> taxes offset by the reduction of tax credits in their home countries. This meant that a US-owned company paid less net taxes. 
Norway<SEP>But even if it is not exactly this scheme, it is certain that any global agreement will have to be supported by a mechanism which allows the developing countries to pollute more while they catch up with developed countries which are simultaneously reducing their emissions. Rich countries are not going to accept proposals from India and the Group of 77 countries for an environmental aid fund which would be administered by the developing nations, but transfers of technology and financial aid will be part of the eventual package. Rajiv Gandhi's call when still India's prime minister at the September 1989 Non-Aligned summit for an $18 million fund based on contributions equivalent to 0.1 per cent of GDP by UN members has the support in principle of the influential Mrs Gro Brundtland of <ENT>Norway<ENT>. The argument will be harsh, and if the threat of disaster is vivid enough to bring about agreement, it may be that nations will find that, in the interest of common purpose, they are little by little surrendering the sovereignty of which Sir Ian Lloyd spoke. 
Spain<SEP>Since then the story in Europe has been essentially one of settling down after the storm. At first the new mountains must have been worn down with great rapidity to produce the vast quantities of Neogene conglomerates. Then there were the molasse-type sands, which in their drab, khaki featurelessness are recognisable in the smallest exposures from <ENT>Spain<ENT> to Bulgaria and beyond. The later shelly sands of the northern Neogene (such as the English " crags " and the French faluns) and the echinoid.bearing limestones of the Mediterranean may represent a return to plate stability. 
Japan<SEP>At the meeting the USA was almost isolated in its opposition to the resumption of loans to Vietnam.

They discussed co-operation in financial markets, specifically over equities and futures trading. 
USSR<SEP>The ` Delhi declaration " of November 1986, for instance, committed the Soviet leader to a ` non-violent " as well as nuclear-free world. An extraordinary gathering, ` the International Forum for a Nuclear-Free World, for the Survival of Humankind ", brought West German Greens, clerics, Academician Sakharov and Western film stars such as Gregory Peck and Claudia Cardinale together in Moscow in February 1987. Gorbachev's address emphasised that the <ENT>USSR<ENT> and its people were ` part of a world community " and that their goal was the ` humanisation of international relations ". A new defence doctrine began to take shape at the same time: it was intended to be non-offensive in character and to give other states no reason to fear for their security, notwithstanding the immense size of Soviet armed forces and the perceptions of those forces that were entertained particularly in Europe. 
France<SEP>About 27 January 1945, shortly after their return to Ravensbrück, all three were shot dead. She was awarded a French croix de guerre in 1944, and a posthumous George Cross in 1946. [ R. J. Minney, Carve her Name with Pride, 1956; M. R. D. Foot, SOE in <ENT>France<ENT>, 1968 edn.; private information. ] 
UK<SEP>The expanded scope audit has been recognized relatively recently. Traditionally, governmental audit has been concerned with the financial and regularity audit. The demand for more public accountability in the 1970s, along with the demand for real reductions in public sector spending in the <ENT>UK<ENT> and the USA, has included demands for greater ` value for money " from government. The supreme audit institutions of both countries, as well as of the profession, have responded with a greater application of and greater publicity about economy, efficiency and effectiveness auditing. 
Germany<SEP>Although they achieved no breakthrough, they reportedly agreed to begin a dialogue on security issues with a view to negotiating a draft peace treaty prior to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, scheduled for Sept. 13-15. Visit to France and Germany by Miyazawa The Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, made a brief official trip to Europe in late April and early May, visiting France on April 29-30 and <ENT>Germany<ENT> on April 30-May 2. In talks with both President François Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Miyazawa was reported to have discussed economic and trade issues, but also to have appealed for support in Japan's territorial dispute with Russia. 
Syria<SEP>Indeed, the governments of the region seem quite ungrateful when the well-meaning secretary of state turns up on their doorsteps. He offers them another unsettling peacemaking idea; they invent another excuse for turning it down. The question during Mr Baker's recent tour was whether Israel's Yitzhak Shamir or <ENT>Syria<ENT>'s Hafez Assad would run out of excuses first. For over 30 years Israel had no need of excuses. 
Channel Islands<SEP>If only it were possible to avoid these difficulties, and go island-hopping where they speak English, where the controllers are friendly and helpful, where all kinds of services are readily available, taxes are low and fuel plentiful. There is such an area near at hand. Visit the <ENT>Channel Islands<ENT> and you will see Britten-Norman Trislanders happily buzzing between the islands and the two adjacent mainlands of England and France. Their bases are Alderney, Guernsey and Jersey. 
China<SEP>From 1870 to 1873 he was outside manager at G. Forrester & Company's Vauxhall foundry, Liverpool, where he had charge of repairs to vessels and the fitting out of new ships. By the time he left Liverpool in 1873 he had been appointed consulting and superintending engineer to a number of shipping companies, including the Flower Line, the Castle Line, and the Eastern Telegraph Company. One particularly notable vessel which he designed was the Stirling Castle, famed for her speed, for example, when in 1882 she brought home a cargo of 6,000 tons of <ENT>China<ENT> tea from Hankow in twenty-eight days, beating the previous best time by more than a week. From 1873 to 1876 he acted as marine superintendent with Hargrove, Fergusson & Jackson, for whom he constructed both ships and machinery, striving always to achieve greater power, efficiency, and economy. 
Singapore<SEP>During this time Thomas was fortunate in that our elder sister and her husband, a Royal Engineer, were also stationed in Malta. On his return to England he had hoped that Maisie and he would be able to marry, but on October 1 he was posted to 36 Squadron at Seletar on Singapore Island - and sadly, the plans for a wedding had to be deferred. Ironically, my father, mother, younger brother and I had recently returned to England from <ENT>Singapore<ENT>, at the end of a four-year posting. In April 1939 Thomas was promoted to Flight Sergeant. 
United States<SEP>It is desirable that as many parties to a conflict as possible apply the humanitarian provisions of the Conventions, and Article 2 facilitates this goal. At the time of an international armed conflict it may be difficult to obtain a formal ratification from a non-party, but acceptance of the provisions for the duration of the conflict may be possible. In Vernicos Shipping Co v. United States 217 the application of the Brussels Convention on State Immunity between Greece (a party) and the <ENT>United States<ENT> (a non-party) was considered. The Convention allowed for application to non-parties on the basis of reciprocity. 
Netherlands<SEP>He monitored the course of the campaign to retake the country, exchanging messages with an M16 man called Frank Foley, who organized the evacuation in an Irish Sea ferryboat of the Royal Family and much of the government. After both Norway and Denmark had fallen, Neville Chamberlain also fell, on May 10. It was the day Hitler tore into Belgium and the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT>, and the day that Winston Churchill became Prime Minister. Edward Carrington was in the flat with Erica when Chamberlain broadcast his farewell. 
Latin America<SEP>Just before the outbreak of war the British diplomatic and consular services numbered only 446 in all, and of these fewer than 150 were career diplomats. Though there had been some growth during the previous hundred years this was slow and unspectacular. The twenty heads of British missions abroad in 1816, when the effects of the country's long political isolation during the Napoleonic wars were still being felt, had increased to thirty-seven by 1860 (mainly because of the emergence of new independent states in <ENT>Latin America<ENT>); but the changes of the 1860s swept away many of the smaller legations in Germany and Italy, and the establishment of diplomatic representatives in China, Japan and one or two other non-European countries in the second half of the century did not compensate for these losses. The same small numbers and slow increase in them can be seen in the services of the other major powers. 
Netherlands<SEP>For example, if the rapid erosion from a cliff edge is feeding sediment to a low-lying area nearby, then the low-lying area may be placed in danger if the cliff erosion is interrupted. According to Dr John Pethick, a coastal geomorphologist at Hull University, the best solution is to avoid building in the worst-affected areas, and to compensate landowners for loss of land to the sea. The compensation should be arranged at a European level, because sediment washed from the UK's east coast can end up strengthening natural sea defences in Belgium, the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT> and Germany. Global warming is contributing to rising sea levels around the world, according to Pethick, at the rate of about one millimetre a year. 
Lithuania<SEP>But with it all, an indomitable hope of the finest calibre. Nathan Cohen himself was the eldest son of Lyon Cohen, one of the really influential men of early Canadian consolidation over five decades, not least among his own Jewish people. His father, Lazarus Cohen (known as Reb Leizer), was formerly a bochur (teacher) in the rabbinical college of Wolozhin, near Wilkovislak in <ENT>Lithuania<ENT>. Born in 1844 to a family noted for its piety and scholarship, Lazarus had decided to emigrate to Canada in 1869, having heard reports of the young country's potential: its federation was then but two years old. 
USA<SEP>Italy The initial impressions of the Italian reform of 1978 suggested a similarly disappointing outcome to that in the <ENT>USA<ENT> . However, there is a dearth of systematic research into the changes effected.
Turkmen<SEP>ASIA - PACIFIC TURKMENISTAN The <ENT>Turkmen<ENT> Council of Ministers decided on July 14 to establish a national guard initially numbering 1,000 and republican armed forces, although with significant involvement by Russia [ see p. 38969 ]; it was expected that the Turkmen Defence Department would become a Ministry, to be headed by current defence chief Danatar Kopekov. 
Britain<SEP>Subject Area: Social change; Deviance; Crime and criminal justice; Police studies; Social structure; Social history The urban riots of 1981, the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland, and the headline-making supporters of many football clubs, combine to give the impression that crowd violence is on the increase in contemporary <ENT>Britain<ENT>. Despite its obvious importance, however, crowd violence is an issue that has received little academic attention in this country, particularly with regard to long-term trends. 
Great Britain<SEP>Telling evidence came from the Medical Officer of Health for Stockton-on-Tees (G.C.M. M'Gonigle) and his co-author, Kirby (1936). There was no doubting the state of the country's unfitness. In the year beginning November 1917 National Service Medical Boards conducted nearly 2.5 million medical examinations in <ENT>Great Britain<ENT>: of every nine men, only three were perfectly fit and healthy, while two were on a definitely ` unfirm plane " of health and strength, three were incapable of undergoing more than a very moderate degree of physical exertion and the remaining one was a chronic invalid. The influenza epidemic of 1918/19 seemed to confirm a national state of unfitness: more than 151,000 deaths were recorded, the highest relative to population for any epidemic since the cholera outbreak of 1849. 
United States<SEP>The Land court in Offenburg ruled on May 7 that Dieter Kaufmann, 37, who had attempted to assassinate Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble in October 1990 [ see p. 37763 ], was mentally unfit to stand trial; he was sent to a closed psychiatric hospital. Kohl's US visit - Germany's foreign policy role On a visit to the <ENT>United States<ENT> on May 19-21 Kohl, accompanied by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, assured his hosts that his government did " not want to see the long-standing Atlantic alliance in any way weakened, still less replaced by a European structure ". In response to criticism of Germany's formal rejection of military involvement in the Gulf war, Kohl said that he aimed " to establish a clear constitutional basis in Germany " for German troops to serve outside the NATO area under the auspices of the UN or the Western European Union (WEU). 
Tunisia<SEP>A decision taken at an emergency session of the Arab League Council, meeting in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on Sept. 10, to transfer the bulk of organization's departments and affiliated apparatus from Tunis to Cairo by Oct. 31, provoked a sharp reaction from some members countries not in attendance. The meeting was boycotted by nine of the 21 members - Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Mauritania, Palestine, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen. The Arab League Secretary-General, Chedli Klibi (<ENT>Tunisia<ENT>), had already resigned on Sept. 3, over alleged accusations from Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, that he had failed in his mandate to discover why some Arab countries had expressed reservations or abstained from voting during the August Arab emergency summit on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait [ see p. 37635 ]. Assad al Assad (Lebanon), an Assistant Secretary-General, was named as Acting Secretary-General. 
UK<SEP>He outlined the long connections of the New River Head site back to early in the 17th century when what was probably the first privatised water company was established by James I (VI of Scotland). Sir Hugh then entertained the water chemists with his personal recollections of more recent events during his ` reign " in the building during the 1970s and 1980s. The meeting then proceeded to the more serious business of the <ENT>UK<ENT> Drinking Water Regulations under the expert guidance of Owen Hydes, the deputy chief inspector of the Drinking Water Inspectorate. Ian Adams (Thames Region, NRA) then widened the regulatory theme beyond drinking waters to the UK and EC legislation on the ground, river, coastal and sea waters and the input of effluents and sludges etc. 
Britain<SEP>He spent 18 years working for Ford, ending up as manager of its Dearborn assembly plant. Most of his senior colleagues, and his predecessor, Marvin Runyon, came from the same stable. Nissan is the extreme case among the seven Japanese car makers settling into America and the three that are in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. Honda has more Japanese managers at its Ohio plant; Toyota in Georgetown, Kentucky, is somewhere in between. 
Spain<SEP>Agriculture and Food Scottish scallops scuppered Scottish scallops, worth about £7,000 and due for export to <ENT>Spain<ENT>, have been buried alive after being found to be contaminated with heavy metals. The scallop beds at Pentland Firth, between Orkney and mainland Scotland, contained unacceptable levels of cadmium and were declared unfit for human consumption. 
Argentina<SEP>Specifically, the Cairns group members have told trade officials meeting in Geneva that they will obstruct progress on the Uruguay round of tariff-reductions under the CATT unless Europe and America start to talk sense on agriculture. This is not altruism. Cairns group members - which include Australia, Brazil, <ENT>Argentina<ENT>, Indonesia, Canada, the Philippines and Thailand - account for about one-quarter of world agricultural trade. None can afford an escalation of subsidies on agriculture exports. 
Italy<SEP>The 5 cm long trunk is composed of a few, very large plates which have a tuberculate ornament. In front there is a pair of powerful, flattened appendages which are hinged on the side of the body 48 Eocene bony fish, Pristigenys substriatus, Monte Bolca, Verona, <ENT>Italy<ENT>. This exquisite fish is preserved flattened on the bedding plane of a flaggy limestone.

Don't really want to he's not very keen on the prospect of going V S O or whatever. 
France<SEP>The battle for passengers has started a ferry price war, as rival firms cut fares to entice cross-Channel shoppers. Coach bookings, too, have soared. One firm is even arranging for convoys of lorries to travel with the coaches to <ENT>France<ENT> and bring back the booty. Kingsferry Coaches boss Peter O'Neill, who is based in Gillingham, Kent, said: ` I think this is a brilliant idea. 
Netherlands<SEP>He was referring to the brigade of Dutch-Belgian infantry that was spread in four ranks either side of the road to block a direct attack from Frasnes. The strangeness lay in the mens' uniforms which were the standard French infantry uniforms. Only the eagle badge on their shakos had been changed, replaced by a ` W " for King William of the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT>, but otherwise the Dutch-Belgians were dressed exactly like the men they were doubtless about to fight. ` You know what to do? " the Prince asked the brigade commander in his native French. 
UK<SEP>There are various portals of entry. Even before birth, the fetus can be infected from the mother's blood via the placenta, and for this reason, pregnant women have their blood tested to detect, e.g. syphilis so that treatment can be provided to ensure that the baby is not infected. Rubella (German measles) can cause devastating damage to the fetus in early pregnancy and girls who have not had an attack of this disease by the age of puberty are offered immunisation against this virus so that any baby conceived would be protected, although this should soon be rare in the <ENT>UK<ENT> because from 1988, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) protection has been available to all infants. Many microorganisms enter the body via the respiratory tract and those who have colds, for example, should minimise the spray from their sneezing and coughing by the use of a paper tissue which can be disposed of safely after one use. 
East Germany<SEP>Chancellor Kohl has been in contact with President Gorbachev since the refugee exodus began in August. Although the details have not been disclosed, the Soviet Union played a key role in convincing the East Germans to let refugees holed up in West German embassies leave for the West. The Chancellor has evidently made it clear to Moscow that West Germany respects <ENT>East Germany<ENT>'s existence as a separate state, that it does not want to alter the present military set-up of Nato and the Warsaw Pact, and that although it aims to overcome the division of Europe, this does not also apply to the political division of Germany - at least for the foreseeable future. The Soviet Union, for its part, let it be known that if serious trouble did break out in East Germany Soviet troops would not move in, as they did to quell the 1953 revolt - so long as the West did not interfere either. 
Gambia<SEP>Thus Attoh Ahuma (who was also known as a clergyman, the Revd S.R.B. Solomon) joined with another local churchman, the Revd Eggijir Assam, to launch the Gold Coast Aborigine, in which they promised to redress what they saw as the colonial imbalance in the education of local Africans: The two men therefore began to produce a series of articles on local African history in order to show that Africa also had a past worth recalling. By the end of the nineteenth century thirty-four newspapers had appeared in Sierra Leone, nineteen in the Gold Coast, nine in Nigeria and one in the <ENT>Gambia<ENT>. During the 1890s four major papers were operating in the Gold Coast, two being published in Accra and two at Cape Coast, two hundred miles away. 
Tunisia<SEP>I'd been trying to go to sleep. I know: instead of going to sleep, let's go to Tunisia. " ` Why <ENT>Tunisia<ENT>? " ` There's a letter asking you to play at an out-of-doors arts festival in the desert somewhere. 
United Kingdom<SEP>Constructed of main braced girders it carried a double rail and road track with a footpath along either side. When open to shipping, the large clear span allowed easy axis for vessels navigating into the East and West Old Docks. At the time of construction the bridge had the distinction of being the largest swing bridge in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT>. 
Indonesia<SEP>Increasingly, he envisaged a great war in the pacific and many others shared his expectations: the prophecy of Jayabhaya was again on everyone's lips. Surely, this was the promised time? Following their occupation of Malaya and Singapore the Japanese invaded <ENT>Indonesia<ENT>. The disastrous naval battle of the Coral Sea on 27 February left Java exposed; on 9 March the Dutch commander-in-chief surrendered. 
Malaysia<SEP>The Sumatran tiger is more closely and deceptively striped than his larger Indian cousin, and quite a bit more intelligent. In 1956 a Dutch ship was bound for home up the Malacca Straits with a cargo of animals for the Amsterdam Zoo, when a large Sumatran tiger burst out of the forward hatch, scattering deck-hands. It sniffed the air once, went to the starboard railing, where the coastline of <ENT>Malaysia<ENT> was clearly visible only four miles away, and returned to bound over the port railing sixty feet into the sea, to begin swimming directly for the shores of Sumatra, a further eighty miles away and still beneath the horizon. But more than elephants, big cats and early man moved down from continental Asia across that early land-bridge to the islands.

Northern Ireland<SEP>Mr. Barry Field To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what progress he has made in privatising the trust ports in Northern Ireland. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT> (Mr. Richard Needham) A proposal for a draft Order in Council, which would provide the necessary powers to enable any of Northern Ireland's trust ports to be privatised, is currently under preparation. 
Greece<SEP>A sudden upsurge to 3,500 on Dec. 31-Jan. 1 was reportedly prompted by a rumour that the Greek authorities were going to seal the border, and on Jan. 2 a Greek government spokesman alleged that the rumour had been deliberately put about by the Albanian authorities in an attempt to rid the country of the Greek minority, which numbered nearly 59,000 according to the 1989 census. The Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis, visiting Tirana on Jan. 13-14, appealed to Albania's Greeks to stay put, and received a promise from Alia that the refugees could return to Albania without fear of punishment. His visit did nothing to stem the exodus, however, and on Jan. 20 the Greek authorities declared that no Albanian would be allowed to enter <ENT>Greece<ENT> without a passport and visa. By this time the number of refugees since Dec. 30 stood at over 11,000. 
Lithuania<SEP>On Feb. 28 she joined the Supreme Council's economic commission, although there were suggestions that she intended to stand in opposition to the administration of President Vytautas Landsbergis. Recall of Soviet ambassador to Iceland It was announced on Feb. 14 that the Soviet ambassador in Reykjavík, Igor Krasavin, was being recalled until " suitable explanations " were given by Iceland regarding the Jan. 31 decision to establish diplomatic relations with <ENT>Lithuania<ENT> as an independent republic. of Communist Party leader Developments in other republics 
Italy<SEP>PATRICK ROBERTSON was born in Edinburgh at 11.22pm on October 19, 1968 (he recently wrote to the hospital to find out the precise hour and minute for his astrologer). In 1971, his father Craig was employed by the British Tourist Authority as deputy manager of its Rome office and his mother Evelyn began teaching there. For ten years, from 1971 to 1981, Patrick and his brother Dom lived in <ENT>Italy<ENT>, in a coachhouse on a country estate just outside Frascati. He went first to an Italian private school and then to the finish English school in Rome. 
Thailand<SEP>SOUTH EAST ASIA The countries considered under this regional grouping are Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and <ENT>Thailand<ENT>. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore are high growth countries without significant developed energy resources while Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines have rapidly developing economies and substantial energy resources. 
UK<SEP>The study confirmed that acid rain was caused mainly by emissions from coal-fired power stations and stated that the huge reserves of sulphur built up in the soil meant that many Scottish and Scandinavian lakes would suffer the effects of acid rain for decades even if sulphur dioxide emissions were cut radically. Although some Scottish lakes had begun to show signs of recovery, this was due to the decline of energy-intensive industries such as iron and steel and not to environmental protection policies. Speaking on March 22, 1990, to scientists who had worked on the project, the then <ENT>UK<ENT> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised that her government would " meet the commitments which it has solemnly accepted " to reduce emissions from power stations [ see pp. 36791-92 ]. However, she appeared to acknowledge that the government was scaling back a £2,000 million (US$3,200 million) plan to fit flue gas desulphurization (FGD) equipment to coal-fired power stations. 
Ireland<SEP>There is still no provision for a national toxic wastes dump. Lakes and rivers in heavily farmed counties such as Cavan have long suffered from irresponsible dumping by farmers. However, a study done by An Foras Forbartha (AFF) - <ENT>Ireland<ENT>'s institute for physical planning and construction research - showed in 1980 that pyrolytic wastes in Irish waters were higher than the EEC directives permit. The survey, of about 80 rivers and lakes, also found that pesticides were comfortably below the EEC levels. 
UK<SEP>She flicked back her long loose hair. ` Oh, I have the measure of Ron Barron, " she contradicted. ` He wanted to consolidate his position within the company by being appointed head of the <ENT>UK<ENT> operation. His argument was that it would free my father to return to the States, but Ron is never so simple. " 
France<SEP>But the ` line to St Petersburg " from Berlin was still open, the tsar detested the French Republic as a nest of revolutionaries and French radicals detested the tsar as the oppressor of the poles. Tunis had driven Italy into Bismarck's arms. There was, therefore, no reason for him to be worried about <ENT>France<ENT>, still isolated in the first half of the decade. Danger to the stability of his Europe appeared, instead, for the first time in the Balkans, where it was impossible to muffle forever the basic clash of interest between Austria-Hungary and Russia. 
Peru<SEP>After centuries of neglect, the indigenous people are waking up. At the June elections, for the first time ever, they got together to block roads and occupy sites, demanding more land, and money for bilingual education. Some indigenous activists say Ecuador's government had better pay attention, or face a guerrilla uprising like that in next-door <ENT>Peru<ENT>. Meanwhile government workers have been striking for a share of the oil windfall. 
Bangladesh<SEP>Relations with south Asian countries South Asian tour by Li Peng Li Peng began a tour of Pakistan, <ENT>Bangladesh<ENT> and Nepal on Nov. 14, 1989, accompanied by Qian Qichen and the Minister for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Zheng Tuobin. The People's Daily of Nov. 24 said that the foreign tour was the first by a Chinese leader since the June massacre and showed that " the vast numbers of Third-World countries are our trusted genuine friends ". 
Greenland<SEP>Whatever the cause of this increase, it may be contributing almost half as much as carbon dioxide in the global greenhouse effect. Although it is well established from modern observations that the methane content of the atmosphere is increasing at a rate of 1.7 per cent per year, about 600 billion kg, accurate measurements go back only 15 years. In an attempt to extend the methane data, H. Craig and C. C. Chou, of the Isotope Laboratory at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, have analysed the methane content of the air bubbles trapped in ice samples drilled from the glacier in southern <ENT>Greenland<ENT>. The samples go back over 30 000 years, and they show that after being constant for most of that time the methane concentration began to increase in 1580 (Geophysical Research Letters, vol 9. p 1221) At the end of the 16th century, the methane concentration began increasing at a rate of 0.114 ppmv per century (parts per million by volume) and around 1915 the rate accelerated to the present figure of 2.5 ppmv per century - if the data can be taken at face value. 
Mexico<SEP>The church's view, that marriages sanctioned by religious ritual should not be broken, is reflected in divorce laws. In several Latin American countries there is no legal concept of divorce. In <ENT>Mexico<ENT>, however, where the state broke with the church quite violently during the revolution, divorce is possible (and, indeed, in some places very easy). The church's opposition to mechanical and chemical contraception and to abortion, greatly encourages the large families that are so characteristic of the region. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>My car was a total write-off. In 1979 I interviewed for the first (and last) time the newly elected Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. The occasion was a documentary film I was making on the life of Airey Neave, the MP who had masterminded her election to the Tory leadership and, as Shadow Secretary of State for <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT>, been killed by an IRA car bomb when leaving the Palace of Westminster. We were informed that the Prime Minister had set aside an hour for us, and she arrived on the dot, nicely accoutred and coiffeured and saying she was ready to go when we were. 
Britain<SEP>Last month she'd phoned England from Turkey to say she was buying supplies for Kurdish refugees in the north of the country. Supplies collected for the charity in Worcester remained in a warehouse in the city, and West Mercia Fraud Squad were asked to investigate the withdrawal of funds from the Worcester branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Last week 2 detectives flew to Turkey to talk to her and she volunteered to return to <ENT>Britain<ENT>. She was booked onto a flight arriving in London at midday but failed to board the plane. 
Hong Kong<SEP>By David Wallen Diplomatic Editor CHINA stepped up the pressure over Hong Kong yesterday, threatening to remove its government after 1997 in complete breach of the handover agreements. The latest outbursts against Governor Chris Patten's democracy package came from the head of China's <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT> affairs office, Lu Ping, who said Mr Patten would be ` condemned through the ages. " It prompted an immediate statement from the Foreign Office trying again to calm the increasingly hostile relations between the two countries. 
Britain<SEP>The past three months have seen almost daily developments, and a 15-minute speech and 15-minute reply can not do justice to the huge amount of information that must be shared and analysed. Over the past few months, I and members of the campaign team visited depositors and BCCI staff members all over the world. We visited Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where we met members of the royal family and other officials; Hong Kong; Gibraltar; and other towns and cities in <ENT>Britain<ENT>. We met people who remain stunned and bewildered, like victims after some great natural disaster. 
Norway<SEP>She writes a letter to us just this morning - she is ill, she can not sing tonight! " ` Don't get angry again, Armand, " Monsieur Firmin said quickly. ` We have Christine Daaé, that young singer from <ENT>Norway<ENT>. She can sing Margarita tonight. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>Discipline: 02: Sociology The research will examine local responses to socio-economic change in two <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT> localities, Newry and Craigavon. The three main objectives of the study are, firstly to examine the nature of individual and collective responses to economic and social change in each area and the factors which influence them. 
Poland<SEP>But when the country went to bed that night, precisely nothing different, or exciting, or decisive had been said or done. Edward Carrington, weary of the chattering and intrigue at Westminster, was home in bed by midnight. His thoughts were not of Britain's fate, nor <ENT>Poland<ENT>'s, but of Hannele's. He ached for her. 
US<SEP>In answer to a journalist's question in Madrid on Oct. 30 as to whom the delegation represented, Husseini replied that they represented " all Palestinians everywhere ". The Palestinians rejected the Israeli demand, repeated by Shamir in his Oct. 7 Knesset address, that the names of the " Palestinian element of the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation " should be " approved " by the Israeli government before the beginning of the negotiations. On Oct. 18 the list of names in the Palestinian negotiating delegation was released by the PLO to <ENT>US<ENT> officials in Jerusalem. Settlement-building policy of Shamir administration 
USA<SEP>Art Zoyd's score adds an extra eerie dimension - unsafe and arousing - to one of the most poetic of all horror films: Murnau's Nosferatu. The quartet carries an instrumental arsenal which gives it the necessary weight to produce the ominous, bass-heavy sounds that accompany Max Schreck's marvellously decrepit, zombie-like portrayal of Count Dracula. With tours in 18 countries and appearances in the <ENT>USA<ENT> and Russia, Art Zoyd ranks as one of the major jazz/rock quartets of the world. Catch them in Brighton before their London performance in the summer.. 
India<SEP>Bennett said: ` The food provided on Thursday was not up to standard so we decided to provide our own. We have been sensible and responsible about food throughout this tour. " Tinned foods had been brought out to <ENT>India<ENT> by various visiting Test and County Cricket Board officials and spectators and at lunch yesterday England's players were able to choose from tuna, boiled ham, corned beef, baked beans, vegetable soup, chicken pate, tea, coffee and boiled rice. Everything was cooked on primus stoves by Bennett himself in pots and pans that had been thoroughly cleaned and rinsed with boiling water. 
China<SEP>this source of graphite produced a material so fine that it could be sawn into drawing and writing sticks. Less pure grades of graphite were discovered all over the world but none had the structure of the Borrowdale type. It was not until Conté fused graphite with <ENT>China<ENT> clay that loose powdered graphite could be formed into drawing lengths, so avoiding the English monopoly on their cut lengths from Borrowdale. As a result, pencils were easy to make and very cheap to produce. 
US<SEP>Court faces dilemma of right to life and death From JOHN LICHFIELD in Washington THE GREAT modern, moral questions of the right to life and the right to death will dominate what may be a landmark session of the <ENT>US<ENT> Supreme Court which begins this week. With the political dust not yet settled from a controversial abortion ruling in July, the nine Supreme Court justices must rule in the next nine months on three other attempts by US states to regulate abortion as well as the right of parents to terminate the life of a brain-dead daughter. 
US<SEP>US hopes high of winning ballot to secure Pacific island nuclear base. By A Correspondent ISLANDERS in the tiny Pacific state of Palau vote in a referendum on February 6 for the seventh time on a deal with the United States which would give the <ENT>US<ENT> strategic military rights in the Western Pacific only 500 miles from the troubled Philippines. Washington is optimistic that voters will at last consent to a treaty called the Compact of Free Association. 
USA<SEP>Biology and racial inequality The most stubborn defence of the biological argument has been provided for systems of racial stratification. In the <ENT>USA<ENT>, black Americans, who make up 12% of the population, have traditionally formed a distinct social stratum at the base of the stratification system. The majority of blacks occupied the most menial and subservient occupational statuses, being employed as agricultural labourers and as unskilled and semi-skilled manual workers in industry. 
Spain<SEP>My mother didn't feel like being left all that time, so she took my two sisters and me to visit her school friend Beryl, who was married to the poet Robert Graves. They lived in a village called Deya, on the Spanish island of Majorca. This was only five years after the war, and <ENT>Spain<ENT>'s dictator, Francisco Franco, who had been an ally of Hitler and Mussolini, was still in power. (In fact, he remained in power for another two decades.) 
Guadeloupe<SEP>AMERICAS FRENCH ANTILLES The French Antilles comprise the two overseas Departments of <ENT>Guadeloupe<ENT> and Martinique. POLITICAL SYSTEM 
UK<SEP>Great care is also needed in considering the concept of differentiation. What is referred to in this book as ` differentiation " is often referred to rather vaguely as ` quality improvement ". The increased competitive pressure experienced by many US and <ENT>UK<ENT> companies as a result of the Japanese emphasis on reliability and the inclusion of ` extras " in basic models has made them much more aware of the need to pay attention to quality. In fact Buzzell and Gale (1987) say that the PIMS data establish that quality is the most important factor in success. 
Panama<SEP>Wanted on drug charges, he may end up at the centre of an extraordinary trial in Miami. US authorities allege that Gen Noriega made millions in illegal profits by allowing drug trafficking to go on freely in Panama. They also accuse the general of permitting banks in <ENT>Panama<ENT> to launder billions of drug money made by the Colombian drug cartels. Such a trial, however, could well prove to be a double-edged sword for the administration, since the general once boasted that he possessed information that would prove highly embarrassing to President Bush. 
Germany<SEP>It can be speculated that the informants recruited in Operation Ward may have been known to the IRA for months or even years. The IRA says the more recent of the documents is dated 26 January 1984. Indeed, it may be that the collapse of the MI5/MI6 informer network in <ENT>Germany<ENT> and other European countries restored the IRA's confidence in its ability to resume operations on the Continent from March 1987, when it placed a car bomb at Rheindalen. The IRA's campaign broadened in March 1988 with the attempt to plant a bomb in Gibraltar.

Britain<SEP>Voice over The Queen's arrival at the New Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes was the beginning of more than just another royal visit. The leaders of <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s main christian churches were there to greet her in this first city church devoted to united worship. It was especially sweet for Roman Catholic Cardinal Basil Hume. 
USA<SEP>This gives an undoubted advantage for the export of Axminster carpets. (v) A market research survey conducted in the <ENT>USA<ENT> had indicated that their interior designers liked Axminster because of the fact that any pattern or logo could be woven into the design. Most contract carpet in the USA is tufted and printed which only makes mass production runs feasible. 
US<SEP>On the general state of the market he felt that there was sufficient signs of returning activity to rule out the future closure of any major outlets. The appointment of Diana Brooks may have radical implications for the management structure of Sotheby's London house. Mrs Brooks, forty-three, has moved up from the role of president of <ENT>US<ENT> operations to overall president and chief executive officer of the company, a newly created post. She joined the company aged twenty-nine and was appointed US president in 1987. 
United States of America<SEP>It's main 32 acre site incorporates the most up-to-date laboratory and production facilities, bearing witness to the commitment to research and development which have played such an important role in the company's dramatic growth. The company is now recognised as one of the largest and most important manufacturers of veterinary ethical pharmaceutical products in the world, with own-label and contract manufacturing services provided. The production facility is licensed to produce high quality pharmaceuticals by most of the world's major governmental agencies including the Department of Health and Social Services in the U.K. and the Food and Drug Administration of the <ENT>United States of America<ENT>. Products manufactured by Norbrook Laboratories include a wide range of injectable antibiotics, intramammary cerates, vitamins, cortisocsteroids, anthelmintics, fluid metabolites, local anaesthetics, oral preparations including liquids, powders, tablets, pastes and aerosols. 
Germany<SEP>` We are " - Frick said, after a long pause, well over half a minute, until he was certain he had everyone's fullest attention - ` at the beginning of history. All we have waited for is now possible. <ENT>Germany<ENT> is divided. Reunification has resurrected the class structure, not based on background, but on wealth. 
United Kingdom<SEP>Introduction Asthma kills 2000 people in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> every year; it is a major cause of hospital admission in all ages and an important cause of work and school absence and has economic and quality of life implications for individual sufferers, their families, and society. Optimal treatment of attacks can be life saving but suboptimal treatment or unnecessary delay in the provision of care can be fatal. 
US<SEP>During a visit to Baghdad on Dec. 11-12 the French Foreign Affairs Minister, Roland Dumas, said that France was ready to discuss new payments facilities with Iraq provided that Iraq settled some arrears in the repayment of F1,850 million as agreed in September. Compensation for Stark attack The International Herald Tribune of May 29, 1989, quoted <ENT>US<ENT> officials as saying that Iraq had agreed to pay $27,300,000 in compensation to the families of the 37 US crew members who had been killed in May 1987 during Iraq's missile attack on the USS Stark in the Gulf [ see p. 35597 ]. 
Brazil<SEP>Whether Type I or Type II disease subsequently occurs depends on the grazing management of the calves following weaning. In countries in the southern hemisphere with temperate climates, such as New Zealand, the seasonal pattern is similar to that reported for Europe with Type I disease occurring in the summer and burdens of arrested larvae accumulating in the autumn. In those countries with subtropical climates and winter rainfall such as parts of southern Australia, South West Africa and some regions of Argentina, Chile and <ENT>Brazil<ENT>, the increase in L3 population occurs during the winter and outbreaks of Type I disease are seen towards the end of the winter period. Arrested larvae accumulate during the spring and where Type II disease has been reported it has occurred in late summer or early autumn. 
Japan<SEP>In any event, I ended up feeling much more in control. " But the second year with HRC very nearly didn't happen. Bradl was originally in line only for an RS250 until the former manager of Honda Germany, Kazuaki Ueda, won his battle for an NSR shortly before returning to HQ in <ENT>Japan<ENT>. ` That ", said a Honda insider, ` was Ueda's farewell gift to Honda Germany. " 
Britain<SEP>The high seroprevalence of toxoplasma IgG among women born in Ireland compared with British born women may reflect differences in the consumption of undercooked meat or unpasteurised milk or in the use of freezers over the past 30-40 years. There are, however, no data to support such speculation. Reduction in the seroprevalence of toxoplasma IgG has been observed in France, Austria, Sweden, and <ENT>Britain<ENT>. In Stockholm seroprevalence fell during 1969-87, coincident with increased consumption of frozen meat. 
Philippines<SEP>In the case of joint ventures (and similar arrangements) there are different issues at stake. Here, the transfer of technology is often the main point of the exercise. In a study of thirty-three European chemical and pharmaceutical joint ventures in Indonesia, Thailand, <ENT>Philippines<ENT>, Singapore and Malaysia, Lasserre (1982) discovered that home-country technicians were not trained to train in specific socio-cultural settings. Training, in any case, was very limited, local staff visits to home-country plants were not very involving, and on-the-job training tended to consist of little more than watching expatriates at work. 
United States<SEP>The third model is the ` American " one, the almost complete absence of feudal relations, ` free " land, in the initial stages of development, no absolute ground rent, well-to-do farmers and a large home market for industry. And what do we see? It is not difficult to see that the [hellip] power and extent of the growth of the productive forces, have reached their highest point in precisely the <ENT>United States<ENT>. This passage is interesting for several reasons. 
Burma<SEP>It was a rule at St Augustine's College that the part of the world to which each student should go should be decided by the Warden and Fellows. Signs were not lacking of my probable destiny. I had been enrolled as a student at Canterbury before I went to Cambridge; during the next four years I was visited by missionaries home on leave from <ENT>Burma<ENT>, though nothing definite was said. Towards the end of my last year I was called by Bishop Knight and asked where I would like to serve. 
Germany<SEP>Sagittal and transverse scans of the gall bladder at its largest dimensions were obtained. Subsequently, after consumption of a test meal, gall bladder images were made every 15 minutes for 2 hours. These images were stored on video tape and processed by a MS-DOS computer, using a video grabber, and processing software (IBAS, Kontron GmbH, Munich, <ENT>Germany<ENT>). Gall bladder volume was calculated with the sum of cylinders method. 
US<SEP>Jaguar's shares soared again on the stock market, closing 62p up at 731p - valuing the company at £1.323bn. As an estimated 5.5 million Jaguar shares changed hands, Ford confirmed that it had been granted early approval by US regulatory authorities to begin building its stake, immediately prompting speculation that it had entered the market. Under <ENT>US<ENT> anti-laws Ford was not due for clearance to buy more than $15m of Jaguar stock until 18 October. The hike in Jaguar's share price since Ford announced its intentions will have a crucial bearing on whether it can put together a defensive deal with GM. 
US<SEP>Four smaller establishments had been recently returned, whilst the huge Clark Field air base - which was severely damaged by the June eruption of Mount Pinatubo volcano [ see p. 38294 ] - was handed back in late November. Although an agreement for an extension of the lease on Subic Bay was negotiated, it was rejected by the Philippine Senate in September [ see pp. 38441-42 ]. Whilst accepting the decision of the Senate, the <ENT>US<ENT> and Philippine governments agreed that the closure of the base should be spread over three years in order to minimize the military and economic dislocation involved. This agreement, however, foundered upon the failure of the two sides to agree upon the details of the plan, and upon the refusal of the USA to depart from its practice of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on board its naval vessels. 
Israel<SEP>PLO ` tried to block airlift' A JEWISH group that helped about 80 Bosnian mostly Muslim refugees fly to <ENT>Israel<ENT> yesterday says the Palestine Liberation Organisation made a last-minute bid to prevent the flight because it did not want Israel to look good. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) also said the French government withdrew its offer of a plane to fly the refugees to Israel, leaving organisers to scramble to find another aircraft. 
Japan<SEP>Contracts overseas are one way that Japanese firms can fight back against a chronic shortage of trained programmers. According to one estimate, the country could be short of as many as 180 000 computer specialists by 1985. The computer business in <ENT>Japan<ENT> is unusual in that most software writing is done by people who use computers, as opposed to the manufacturers of the machines. Computer owners in Japan do not favour the trend in the West of designing general-purpose software packages. 
UK<SEP>EC UK plans for social affairs The <ENT>UK<ENT> presidency has planned only one Social Affairs Council, to be held on 1 December. The new president in office at the EC Social Affairs Council, Tristan Garel­Jones, told the European Parliament in July that he was ready to place a great deal of importance on social problems and to work for the improvement of social conditions for all European citizens. 
Greece<SEP>More familiar, but also effective, was the notion of workshops, engaging participants in relevant exercises. Here they were designed to offer practical advice and examples on the theme of ` alternative " and ` exploratory " forms of reporting. One other noticeable feature was that nearly 30% of participants were from institutions outside the United Kingdom, with Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Eire, <ENT>Greece<ENT>, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, South Africa and the U.S.A. all represented. The two keynote speakers from America provided a suitably balanced focus. 
UK<SEP>CELL CULTURE HT-29 cells were maintained as a monolayer of cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Flow Laboratories, High Wycombe, UK) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Serolabs, Crawley, <ENT>UK<ENT>). Cells were incubated at 37°C in 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 and the medium was changed every 2 days. 
Switzerland<SEP>ZURICH WHAT do Californian rice farmers, American car dealers, Swiss dentists and English local authorities have in common? They are all target markets for Zurich Insurance, <ENT>Switzerland<ENT>'s biggest insurer and among the world's largest. Zurich - which had gross premium income of SFr21.5 billion ($15.3 billion) last year, mostly from its non-life business - has decided to become a specialist insurer on a global scale.

Bogs are not at all renewable in the strict sense, because the unique historical archive stored in the past can never be replaced.

A further Sh.1,050,000/ - had to be found if they were to survive, and no extra money had been voted by Parliament. The Nationalist and Uhuru were not commercial propositions, neither were they intended to be - they existed to give TANU and its government a mouthpiece both within <ENT>Tanzania<ENT> and in the outside world - but both were losing money more heavily than anticipated.

Hong Kong<SEP>Now having seen one miracle, Hong Kong rugby wants another one from Simpkin. Breaking new ground. As the colony's new coach, Simpkin has initiated a successful programme to develop rugby amongst <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT>'s Chinese population, as well as encouraging the game to take root on mainland China. Here he meets Professor Cao Xihuang (left) before China entertains its first touring side. 
Japan<SEP>Either two or three demonstration reactors are planned for completion by 2030. Fast-breeder reactors require large quantities of plutonium. This has led to concern by environmental groups that some may fall into the hands of terrorists or governments keen to develop nuclear weapons, during shipment to <ENT>Japan<ENT>. Immediate needs are scheduled to be met by buying in spent fuel reprocessed in the UK and France, as well as Japan's own reprocessing activities. 
Germany<SEP>German waste for Scotland? Highly radioactive used fuel rods from German research reactors may be sent to the Dounreay nuclear plant, in northern Scotland, for storage, according to a secret German government report obtained by anti-nuclear groups. The waste involves 1,000 used fuel rods from west Germany, and over 2,000, originally supplied by the Soviet Union, from the Rossendorf reactor in east <ENT>Germany<ENT>. West German fuel rods were formerly sent for storage in the USA, until the practice was halted by environmental objections in 1988.

Hungary<SEP>The book examines the haulage operations of the European members of the CMEA (the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) including Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary. There is an overall view of international haulage in Europe, a detailed analysis of the trade between the CMEA states and the EC, and the legislative and commercial framework within which this trade is undertaken. For Bulgaria, Czechoslavakia, <ENT>Hungary<ENT> and Poland the author provides an overall summary of each country's economy and a detailed picture of the various national transport undertakings operating international services to and from these countries. This includes operators familiar on UK and continental roads such as CSAD of Czechoslavakia and Hungarocamion and reveals that SoMat of Bulgaria, operating in the region of 3,800 HGVs, is the largest trucking company in the world. 
America<SEP>` Wish-fulfilment " movies Apocalypse Now appeared at a time when the political climate in <ENT>America<ENT> was shifting to the right, resulting in Reagan's victory in the 1980 presidential elections. The rise in American self-esteem that followed Reagan's more aggressive foreign policies led to a greater acceptance of the ` revisionist " view of the war. 
Hong Kong<SEP>Hong Kong Special Report: Slogans By DEREK DAVIES ` Hong Kong People Rule Hong Kong ": the slogan propagated by China during the 1982-84 sovereignty negotiations, to encourage popular local support for its demand that Britain withdraw completely from the administration of <ENT>Hong Kong<ENT> on 30 June 1997.

China<SEP>In relation to the latter, the reduced flow of fresh water into the estuary will allow the intrusion of salt water and thus affect biological productivity that will rebound on fisheries and the supply of water for industrial, agricultural and domestic use. Increased salinisation is thus a real prospect for the lower Yangtze if this project proceeds. Here, the cause will be a very different one to that associated with irrigation but may have significant repercussions for the exacerbated salinisation of one of <ENT>China<ENT>'s most productive agricultural regions. 
Southern Rhodesia<SEP>It wasn't long before other families on board were sending their children to join in the fun. The few weeks with her own family flew past. By October Eva was being farewelled from Australia to " her first appointment on missionary service to the Howard Institute in <ENT>Southern Rhodesia<ENT> " (Australian War Cry November 15th 1952). At the service she prayed that God would fill her heart with love for the people to whom she was to minister. 
West Germany<SEP>` I promise, " he told them, ` that I shall not fail your trust and that I shall lead the country to free elections. These elections must take place in a clean and decent way so that our revolution is not tarnished. " The new President's first state visits next week will be to East and <ENT>West Germany<ENT> to meet acting President Manfred Gerlach in East Berlin and President Richard von Weizsacker - and Chancellor Helmut Kohl - in Munich. Mr Miroslav Stepan, the politburo member who has been accused of setting the riot police on the demonstrators, has been charged. 
America<SEP>The year before the Baptists had sent a telegram to Queen Victoria congratulating her on completing the longest reign in British history. When a reply arrived which simply said, ` The Private Secretary is commanded to express the thanks of The Queen for the kind message of congratulation which you have forwarded to Her Majesty ", the assembly rose to its feet and cheered. As in so many things, the ways of the Victorians, while looked on with horror in late twentieth-century England, have survived in <ENT>America<ENT>; unashamed fervour in holding and expressing religious and patriotic beliefs which easily blend into one another is but one example. The reaction was not against passionate expression of beliefs or against an audience's supporting a speaker: it was against excessive displays and rhetoric more appropriate to a political rally than to a religious meeting. 
Switzerland<SEP>In the bleak brick corridor that, tonight, the three of them are obliged to call a dressing room, the atmosphere is as buoyant as a funeral. Somewhere in central Europe, it seems as if Lemonheads lost their sense of fun. In reality, though, the trouble only started here in Aarau, <ENT>Switzerland<ENT>, a few minutes ago. An advance copy of their new single, ` It's A Shame About Ray ", has arrived, with the label wrongly accrediting ` Shaky Ground ", the B-side, to Evan Dando and his friend Tom Morgan, rather than Morgan and Nic Dalton, the bassist. 
United Kingdom<SEP>Richard Corish held a seat in Wexford from 1921 until his death in 1945. His son Brendan then inherited the seat and kept it until his retirement in 1982. In the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> an MP wanting to retain his seat is usually re-adopted as a candidate. So he would be under the STV, and in many constituencies his re.adoption would be practically as it is now a guarantee of his return to Westminster. 
Ursa Major<SEP>LYNX: the Lynx A very obscure constellation, lying mainly between <ENT>Ursa Major<ENT> and Gemini. Its two brightest stars, Alpha (3.1) and 38 (3.9) are in the same × 7 field. 
US<SEP>That first presidential order to send American troops into possible combat was taken on the run, as Bush was preparing for his first superpower summit with Mikhail Gorbachev at Malta. Bush was affable and even supportive of Gorbachev's reforms, keen to make the meeting a success. But this readiness to intervene in the Philippines was a useful message to send to a Soviet leader still exploring the thinking and the reactions of the new <ENT>US<ENT> President. Mr Bush's clear determination to continue with America's global role added force to his blunt rejection of Gorbachev's call for naval nuclear disarmament. 
Australia<SEP>The Jones and Minogue families were prominent figures in Melbourne's Welsh society - the Cymdeithas Cymraeg - joining each March 1st in the St David's Day celebrations and eisteddfods or singing festivals. And they kept in close contact with the family in Wales. In particular they never forgot Dennis and Joan Riddiford, Millie's brother and sister-in-law whose life together in <ENT>Australia<ENT> was cruelly cut short when Dennis contracted malaria. Kylie wrote regularly to the Riddifords and also her great aunt, Dilys Evans, a sprightly 80-year-old who still worked as a waitress in the town of Maesteg. 
United Kingdom<SEP>US airforce wives must pay poll tax, appeal court rules By John Grigsby, Local Government Correspondent THE BRITISH wives of American servicemen stationed in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT> must pay the poll tax even though they receive little or no benefit from public services, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. Lord Justice Mann, sitting with Lords Justice Purchas and McCowan, said that the wives were not covered by the term ` exempt individuals " in the community charge legislation. 
France<SEP>On 1 July a SOFRES poll in Le Figaro showed that 69 per cent of those asked predicted a ` Yes " vote. As the summer progressed and copies of the Maastricht Treaty were distributed, understanding of what had been conceded by the politicians began to grow. Across central <ENT>France<ENT>, in the mairies of small towns, there was a tangible feeling that too much was being given to remote and unelected bureaucrats, that the political class did not speak for France. It is important to be clear about one thing; contrary to a widely held belief, those who voted ` No " to Maastricht were not voting ` No " to Mitterrand. 
United States of America<SEP>Foreign policy. " There are those who say that we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are the <ENT>United States of America<ENT>, the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world. As long as I am President we will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, and not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. " 
Britain<SEP>Thus, in this diagrammatic representation of photography, fashion is also shown in the curious mirror devised for it by Cindy Sherman, and advertising returns a regard shaped by the " electronic scissors " -as he calls his camera - of Richard Prince. Advertising has reached, we believe, a quite remarkable development in the 1980s, and perhaps nowhere more than in the United Kingdom. (It will be clear that PHOTOGRAPHY NOW gives no special favouritism to work from <ENT>Britain<ENT> - but our belief that work here is at a very impressive pitch of creativity is echoed internationally, judging from the exhibitions and other attention from around the world, and much of the Museum's collection can be found in the Aperture publication BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHY: TOWARDS A BIGGER PICTURE, published in New York in November 1988). " We believe that British advertising is in a class of its own for inventiveness, elegance and sophistication. 
France<SEP>Of the East European members, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia would subscribe small amounts and the Soviet Union 6 per cent. Other member countries were the remaining 13 OECD member countries - with the United states providing 10 per cent and Japan 8.5 per cent of the capital - and Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Liechtenstein, Malta, Mexico and Morocco. London was chosen as the administrative headquarters, and Jacques Attali, formerly a special adviser to President Mitterrand of <ENT>France<ENT>, was elected president for an initial four-year term at a meeting in Paris on May 19. These decisions, supported respectively by 23 and 32 countries, provoked a walkout by the Dutch delegate, who complained that they exemplified the lack of consideration of the larger EC members for the smaller member countries, and that the outcome of the voting had been " deviously stage-managed " to present a fait accompli based on an Anglo-French deal reached at the IMF Group of 7 meeting on May 6 [ see p. 37474 ]. 
Spain<SEP>The semi finals followed on the Friday. Simon Parsons was last in his semi but at the line he was closing on Vekic of Jugoslavia. The third semi was very close (0.55 secs) between Crichlow (Canada), Herbert (USA) and Vincente (<ENT>Spain<ENT>), the latter being lucky to get a time as he fell out of his K1 crossing line. The ladies' K1 required a first 4 placing plus the best 5th.

Irans<SEP>Despite the assault, the US government announced that it would maintain normal diplomatic relations with the new Iranian regime. One reason, which Secretary of State Cyrus Vance has mentioned, was the protection of American lives, and another was to prevent'sensitive military and intelligence equipment form falling into unfriendly hands ". On 21 February Sullivan called on Prime Minister Bazargan to assure him, and through him Khomeini, that the US accepted the revolution and would not interfere in <ENT>Irans<ENT> internal affairs. He even offered to continue to supply arms - thought at this time the new regime was trying to get the United States to buy back some of the more expensive equipment that the Shah had purchased.

Norway<SEP>In dramatic Saunderson fashion, Llewellyn declared he was finished with Ireland and left to spend his later years travelling Europe, the young and lovely Olive in tow. They wintered in San Moritz. Olive Saunderson and Norman Field met and fell in love in predictably romantic circumstances when the Fields and the Saundersons were guests on board Lord Vestey's yacht on a cruise to <ENT>Norway<ENT> in 1909 They were married the same year in Dublin and returned to England to set up home. The family Olive Saunderson married into had a story to equal her own, also stretching back to the seventeenth century when Zachariah Field left Yorkshire to settle in Massachusetts as a yeoman farmer Norman Field's father was born there in 1831.

Australia<SEP>` I would have done a great deal more, Hilary, " he told her seriously. ` I wanted you - and what I want I try very hard to get. " Feeling suddenly shy, she looked down, and asked huskily, ` And, in return for a trip to <ENT>Australia<ENT>, the colonel told you all about me? " ` Mm. 
Britain<SEP>Ms Reeves explains: ` With each of the really serious cases - rape, murder, racial harassment - there simply isn't anyone to refer people on to. So we've had to do a lot of work ourselves, including researching carefully that we are doing something worthwhile. " This research influences the way volunteers work with victims but it is also passed on by Victim Support to other organisations that might find it useful: it provides an input into every police training course in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, and that has led to a potential new area of work. Former police officers now doing security jobs in shops, banks and offices have begun to ask Victim Support to provide help for employees who have become victims of crime through robberies or other incidents at the workplace. 
South Africa<SEP>Responding to the changed situation, SADC leaders indicated that South Africa would itself be invited to join once a democratically elected government was in place. They also expressed a desire to institute mechanisms for co-operation and integration before then, although the need to safeguard against South African economic domination in the region was stressed. Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress (ANC), who attended the summit as an observer, was cautious about the role of a post-apartheid <ENT>South Africa<ENT>. He warned that the " appalling legacy of apartheid " would limit its initial contribution. 
Britain<SEP>Referees and opponents who have crossed Souness during this dreadful Anfield season swear he must have had a humour and charisma bypass at the same time. World heavyweight boxing ends the year much as it started this year and almost every other year - in total chaos. Riddick Bowe's World Boxing Council belt ended up in the trash can, Mike Tyson ended up in the can, and Lennox Lewis became <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s first world heavyweight champion without even hitting anyone. Frank Bruno, after only three fights since quitting pantomime, is apparently lined up to fight both champions. 
Malta<SEP>The younger enthusiasts of revolution, those who fervently accepted the ideals of The Green Book, seemed not to recognize the hard political work of the administrators nor to pay much attention to such discrepancies between ideology and practice as forced themselves into the consciousness of Libyans with wider experience of the ways of government. So it was only on rare occasions that the issue of local sovereignty arose: usually when a person - a single individual - got carried away by indignation or by enthusiasm to raise points which prudent men, a little weary of what they considered to be rhetoric, tended to suppress. The 1979 local Assemblies throughout the country debated Libya's relations with <ENT>Malta<ENT>; they were to advise on the question whether Libya should give economic aid to her ally. In Ajdabiya a young man, Wunis Abdulhadi, the brother of the lawyer Abdulsalam Abdulhadi, pointed out that The Financial Times had already announced the formation of Libyan-financed joint enterprises and that the government had given months ago; he concluded there was no point in discussing the issue.

In 1942 Cecil Beaton returned to England in a flying-boat from a three month tour of Egypt, Iraq and Persia as an official war photographer. After take-off Beaton surveyed his surroundings: ` Silk-lined walls, arm chairs like Pullmans, various compartments for eating, sleeping, smoking - this is the aircraft that took Churchill to <ENT>America<ENT> [hellip] how grateful I am to be among the lucky ones on the last lap for home. " The last flying-boat service out of Britain was in 1958.

Australia<SEP>Would it not make more sense to have a moratorium on pit closures in the interests of jobs, the balance of payments and European energy conservation? Mr. Wakeham I agree with the hon. Gentleman that British coal is the cheapest in western Europe, but it is certainly not cheaper than coal from the United States or <ENT>Australia<ENT> and it is still uncompetitive in world terms. However, the next coal contracts will be at competitive rates and I believe that they will be satisfactory for British Coal. 
Great Britain<SEP>But there are also maternal ailments attributable to the number of births, the ages at which women bear children and possibly also to the amount of time that elapses between births, presumably, among other things, because the reproductive pattern influences ability to meet demands that pregnancy and breastfeeding make upon the body. Analyses of data for several developed countries confirm that maternal age and parity appear profoundly to affect mothers' health before and after confinement. Results of studies carried out in <ENT>Great Britain<ENT> and the United States serve as illustrations. Maternal complications occurring in reputable hospitals in the United States during the 1960s revealed a strong association of childbearing patterns with complications of pregnancy and delivery.

The declaration calling for talks on <ENT>Estonia<ENT>'s independence was endorsed on Feb. 22 by the Estonian Supreme Soviet, which on Feb. 23 elected its Presidium President, Arnold Rüütel;, to head a commission to conduct these talks. At its session on Feb. 23 the Estonian Supreme Soviet, emulating Lithuania and Latvia [ see pp. 37129; 37168 ], decided to abolish the clauses in Article 6 of the Estonian Constitution guaranteeing the " leading role " of the Communist Party.

Panama City<SEP>I had the somewhat faint hope that he might lead me to the place and permit me to stand where Balboa had stood - on the very peak which John Keats, with the kind of monumental mistakenness permitted under the principle of poetic licence - declared was occupied by: [hellip] stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes He stared at the Pacific - and all his men Looked at each other with wild surmise - Silent, upon a peak in Darién. I went to Miami and booked myself aboard a late-night Pan American jumbo jet to <ENT>Panama City<ENT>, arriving shortly before dawn in the pullulating and insufferably hot shanty-capital sprawling beside that most famous of all entrances to the world's greatest of seas. When Panama City awakened, and after I had taken a small breakfast of pineapple, café con leche and a hard roll or two, I rented a small white Japanese car, acquired a map from the official cartographers who conduct their business under the curious name of the Instituto Geografico Nacional Tommy Guardia, and set out to look for Santa Fé, for William - and for the Pacific.

And she responded by telling them she was no tycoon, just a wife and mother with an unusually clear view of the world. 
Saudi Arabia<SEP>That can lead only to a number of results. It means that Britain will no longer have a permanent presence in the Security Council in 10 or 15 years' time. It also means that there will be occasions when decisions can not be taken, such as that taken by the former Prime Minister at Aspen, with President Bush, to put troops into <ENT>Saudi Arabia<ENT>. Such decisions will not be able to be made by a single Prime Minister without reference back. 
Australia<SEP>States with no declaration are third parties to the jurisdictional scheme. In Nuclear Tests unilateral statements of the French authorities were said by the Court to have been made ` publicly and erga omnes ". France had therefore bound itself with respect to all States, including <ENT>Australia<ENT> and New Zealand, leaving no State as a third party. The adversarial nature of contentious proceedings before the International Court ensures that the parties are readily identifiable. 
US<SEP>Defense officials say they have not yet forbidden any publication, but insist that they possess the power to do so if they choose. The claimed legal instrument is an acrobatic interpretation of the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations - under which, the security pushers insist, public disclosure of scientific knowledge can be restricted, even if it is unclassified. The promotion of restrictions extends beyond the <ENT>US<ENT> . The State Department, for example, has blocked the funds of scientists bound for Poland as an expression of political disapproval of the Polish regime.

Following the successful test, Guinness Draught Bitter was launched nationally in the <ENT>UK<ENT> in early 1992 and sales have outperformed all expectations. 
United Kingdom<SEP>Mr. John D. Taylor Despite the major differences between the Conservative party and the Ulster Unionist party following the imposition by the Conservative party of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and partial Dublin rule through Stormont, will the Minister accept on a personal level that there is widespread respect throughout Northern Ireland for the contribution that he has made to the rejuvenation of Royal avenue in our capital city of Belfast? Does he recognise that it is one of the commercial miracles of Northern Ireland and is now envied by many areas in the <ENT>United Kingdom<ENT>? Should he not be with us in six weeks, will he leave a message for his successor to ensure the continuation of that economic miracle into York street and York road in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker)? 
UK<SEP>The rise of the ` multinationals " has received much comment and I shall not go into great detail here. What is of particular interest is that direct investment overseas by such enterprises has become increasingly important over the post war years (as opposed to portfolio investment, of which British capital has a long tradition), and that this phenomenon is especially important for the British economy. In 1971 the <ENT>UK<ENT> was second only to the USA as a home base for multinational companies; overseas production by British-based multinationals as a proportion of domestic output in 1977 was, at 40 per cent, higher than the corresponding figure for any other national economy except Switzerland; and in 1971 nearly 20 per cent of UK output was produced by overseas based companies. Both ` foreign " multinationals operating within Britain and British enterprises with substantial overseas production facilities can ` plan " the international distribution of their profit-making taking into account comparative costs, the state and growth rate of national markets and the degree of militancy or subordination of labour.

After months of legal wrangling in the effort to have him extradited to <ENT>Jersey<ENT> to face trial on charges of murdering his parents, whose bodies have never been found, his case is due to be heard at Gibraltar's Court of Appeal on 24 March. The defence is appealing against a ruling by the colony's Supreme Court that a tape recording made by Scottish police at a Perthshire hotel of an alleged confession was admissible as evidence by the Crown. 
Iran<SEP>Ceausescu's aim in issuing such a threat was probably to frighten Hungary, but Romania already has the delivery system in the form of Soviet built Scud missiles and is believed to be developing its own missile with the help of Egypt and Iraq. The picture emerging from Romania this week is of a country barely under control. In his television broadcasts since returning from <ENT>Iran<ENT>, Ceausescu has looked under severe pressure. When he visited Moscow in October 1988, Gorbachev asssured him that ` the Romanian people can be confident that it will always find in the Soviet people a reliable ally, a useful partner, and a true friend. " 
South Korea<SEP>In March 1990 there was a wholesale dismissal of those Cabinet Ministers responsible for the economy [ see p. 37319 ]. The new team moved the focus of economic policy away from the attempt to close the gap between rich and poor and returned to the pursuit of export-led high growth rates. Although <ENT>South Korea<ENT> recorded a growth rate of 9.1 per cent in 1990, this was achieved largely through a boom in the construction industry manufactured by a government-backed residential building programme which aimed to construct 2,500,000 new housing units in 1988-92. Increased levels of domestic consumption (including expenditure on luxury items), however, suggested that a more fundamental shift was under way whereby the dynamic of the South Korean economy was changing from one which was export-led to one based upon domestic demand. 
UK<SEP>However, at present, they spend only $800 million on population programmes, equivalent to just 1.2 per cent of their total aid budget. At the preparatory meeting in Geneva, Scandinavian countries had proposed increasing spending on population control programmes to 4 per cent of all overseas aid by the year 2000. This was rejected by other states, including the UK and US: a <ENT>UK<ENT> representative said it could " lead governments to spend money on projects regardless of their quality ". This was despite growing evidence that birth rates are falling in key third world states simply as a result of more widespread availability of contraceptives. 
Britain<SEP>This may be seen from the range of those who went to press on the subject in 1989 and 1990. Douglas Hurd, then Home Secretary, and a number of other Conservative ministers began to extol the virtues of ` active citizenship " as a way of overcoming the lack of a sense of responsibility to the community, lawlessness and overdependence on the state. Paddy Ashdown advocated a " Citizens' Britain " of free, participating, secure individuals in place of what he saw as a ` Citadel <ENT>Britain<ENT> " of oppressed, stressed people and a closed political system. In April 1990 the Prince of Wales launched his ` Volunteers " scheme, under which young people would have opportunities to contribute to the public welfare and learn the value of participation and the feeling of belonging to the community through voluntary work.

Germany was reported on Oct. 15 to have agreed to co-operate with France in an attempt to sell tanks worth US$300 million to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in competition with UK and <ENT>US<ENT> tank manufacturers.

There was even an excuse for ministers, suggested by a Whitehall official, in case the trade was unearthed by the press.

USA<SEP>The solution in Cunningham's own school (Madeley Court, Telford) was a sophisticated library resource centre, on two levels, with a multi-media collection of materials, reprographic and audiovisual production facilities, and trunking to the library and other areas of the school through which audio-programmes could be distributed on command. Naturally, the facility required ancillary staffing in all areas, as well as a teacher as Head of Resources with a curriculum development brief. At the time this was perhaps the most lavishly equipped school of its kind in the UK (though there were many more lavish examples still in the richer areas of the <ENT>USA<ENT>) but its strength was to be the participation of its library resource centre personnel and the head of resources in the in-service education of the teachers. A new school beginning from scratch can plan in this way without arousing the instant suspicion and hostility of old stagers in the staff room. 
Northern Ireland<SEP>No wonder that after the intense psychological preparation for the big move which never came, many became disillusioned with hachshara and left. Gwrych Castle was abandoned by Youth Allyah in 1941. The casualty list soon spread to other centres such as Clonin Castle and Millisle Farm in <ENT>Northern Ireland<ENT>, where travel restrictions made communication with central office in London all but impossible. Finance too became a problem. 
Japan<SEP>Despite its enormous restructuring problems, Big Steel has not been Japan's greatest raiser of cash. Japanese banks have gobbled up more, and until recently accounted for around half of all equity capital raised by Japanese companies. Over the past two years <ENT>Japan<ENT>'s five largest city (ie, national commercial) banks raised ¥3 trillion ($21 billion) in total - to help them meet the new capital-adequacy requirements set under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). With their low capital ratios (ie, equity as a proportion of assets), Japanese banks were accused in the mid-1980s of unfair competition for international clients.

Such bills had been enacted in 10 instances -the states of Utah, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Nebraska, West Virginia and Michigan, and the territory of <ENT>Guam<ENT>. As of the end of June 1991 at least six of these statutes were undergoing the process of appeal which would almost certainly bring them eventually to the Supreme Court, where any of them could serve as the occasion for the reversal of the 1973 landmark abortion rights ruling, Roe v.

France<SEP>No matter what reservations Churchill might have entertained about the Atlantic Charter and whether or not freedom was meant to apply to colonial territories, the unworthiness of France to return to Indochina was soon to become one of Roosevelt's fixed ideas on colonialism and an issue that would bedevil relations between all the Allied powers in Southeast Asia with the possible and ironic exception of the Soviet Union. At least Churchill is on record that Roosevelt had been more outspoken with him on the subject of Indochina than on any other colonial matter: ` I imagine it is one of his principal war aims to liberate Indochina from France ". And while Roosevelt was to some extent restrained by the State Department and, even more, after the US had recognized de Gaulle's government in October, 1944, by considerations of reconstituting <ENT>France<ENT> as at least a European power, there was, on the operational level, a situation developing in southern China, in which the US was involved, which would affect the fortunes of the Vietnamese revolutionaries, their appearance, their standing with other Vietnamese patriots, and their ability to influence future events. Shortly after the US had entered the war Ho's personal fortunes had reached their lowest ebb.

Owners, whose holiday brands include Sovereign, Enterprise and Falcon, had sought an alliance with German-owned Thomas Cook to cement its position in the competitive <ENT>UK<ENT> market, but fast-growing and highly-profitable Airtours came in with a rival bid to spark off weeks of rhetoric and activity which finally ended yesterday. ` We are very happy, " Owners managing director Roger Allard said. 
Britain<SEP>When we stopped at traffic lights people on the pavements stared in at us [hellip] slightly embarrassing at first to a normally law-abiding citizen. But we couldn't call out ` Ban the Bomb " or display our CND badges to show that we were not really criminals (Buxton and Turner, 1962, p. 2). It seemed so funny that all I had done was take part in an extremely well­mannered demonstration against nuclear weapons; yet here I was under lock and key, in the custody of the State and presumably in the company of many of the worst criminals in <ENT>Britain<ENT> (Buxton and Turner, 1962, p. 3). Pat Arrowsmith has had numerous arrests and spells of imprisonment as a pacifist campaigner. 
Canada<SEP>Yes he was the stocker at Tormore. Who was he employed with then? Well the estate er er er the Duke of Sutherland had the whole of Assynt and then h General Stewart who was born in Nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in <ENT>Canada<ENT> on the C P R. Canadian Pacific Railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in out to Canada. 
Uganda<SEP>The long-term prediction is that the only defence against AIDS lies in effecting behavioural changes and anthropologists are being employed to study behavioural aspects. This study will benefit anthropological findings by providing the broader context of the history of public health; the history of medical research in Africa; changes over time of African cultural perceptions of health and disease; and, the socio-economic history of AIDS in specific regions. Investigation methods will include the creation and use of a research network; one year's fieldwork in southern <ENT>Uganda<ENT> and eastern Zaire; and use of secondary sources. Research results will be published in a monograph. 
Singapore<SEP>The plaintiff was assessed to corporation tax for accounting periods covering the years 1977 to 1985. Appeals against these assessments had reached the Special Commissioners, but none had been concluded. On 2 October 1990 the inspector requested accounts of and details of transactions with one of the plaintiff's subsidiaries, B (Pte) Ltd (a <ENT>Singapore<ENT> company), as it was possible that this information would lead to the amendment of existing assessments. The Revenue wished to consider whether adjustments needed to be made by virtue of s 485, TA 1970, whereby transactions carried out between buyers and sellers under common control are deemed to take place at market value. 
Hungary<SEP>Yet nobody knows how people will react if some suddenly get a lot richer and some a lot poorer. Do East Europeans want their capitals to resemble New York, with its skyscrapers of wealth alongside slum ghettos? In <ENT>Hungary<ENT> in 1977, the top-earning fifth of households got 32% of total household income, the bottom fifth 11%. In Poland in 1982, the best-off fifth of ` employee households " - anybody not on a farm or retired - got 31% of total ` employee " income. 
USA<SEP>She has been looking for one for a long time. Cally's daffy, lovesick admiration of the TV star, her assumption that Jen knew everyone in all her favourite soaps and shows and could tell her the most amazing things about them if she chose to, her unremitting star-struck attitude brought home to Jen that this was her life - she had become public property. Just as it had palled in London, so, after she met Robert, it began to pall in the <ENT>USA<ENT> . Robert speeded up the process.

North America<SEP>While a great deal has been written about railways in migration, little notice has been taken of the role of the railway station. Throughout western Canada and the United States, in the interior of Latin America, in Australasia and the settler territories of Africa, the provision of railway stations was the vital adjunct of settlement. Although railway-building in <ENT>North America<ENT> has been described above as ` quintessentially capitalist ", in fact railway companies were prepared to build to the West only in return for massive inducements. The American western railroads received no fewer than 155 million acres of land as subsidies and guarantees. 
United States of America<SEP>It appears that he appointed as his prime minister, Mr. Omer Arteh Qalib. In July 1991 after a continuous period of widespread fighting between the various groups including the two U.S.C. factions, a conference was called at Djibouti under the chairmanship of the President of the Republic of Djibouti. It was attended by the Presidents of Kenya and Uganda and representatives of the Governments of Germany, the <ENT>United States of America<ENT>, France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Oman, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and China and of the Arab League, the Organisation of African Unity and the European Economic Community. From within Somalia six of the groupings were represented. 
France<SEP>If Stefan Edberg is your kind of tennis player, stick to cognac. If you want something with a bit more bite, go for armagnac. The basic difference between <ENT>France<ENT>'s two great grape brandies is the method of distillation. Cognac is distilled twice, most armagnac once. 
Cuba<SEP>Even by the second decade of this century, the illiteracy rate for the Brazilian population was about 80 per cent. By 1950, there had been improvements but they were slow in taking place. In that year, with the exception of Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, <ENT>Cuba<ENT> and Uruguay, the illiteracy rate of populations aged over fifteen years, exceeded 30 per cent in all Latin American countries, 50 per cent being recorded in Brazil and higher percentages in Central America (Rama 1983: 16). It is since the 1950s that the expansion in education has really accelerated, with a resulting boost to literacy rates. 
Sweden<SEP>Significantly, more recent housing in the same development has been constructed without either high-rise building or segregated traffic arrangements. These experiences in Holland are by no means unique. Similar criticism has emerged from elsewhere, such as in <ENT>Sweden<ENT> where the so-called SCAFT guidelines for the layout of residential neighbourhoods on traffic segregation principles have led to ` dull residential areas " with operating difficulties for public transport services. Wherever such arrangements have been attempted, they have led to the growing realisation that segregation does not provide a balanced solution for both traffic and environmental problems. 
Japan<SEP>The socialisation of credit risk If it happens, this corporate death toll is unlikely to include famous names. The gap between the financial state of <ENT>Japan<ENT>'s biggest and strongest firms - generally those familiar in the West - and the smaller and weaker ones has widened. In the past that gap was bridged by the commercial banks who, in effect, took from the strong (which included themselves) to give to the weak. 
Canada<SEP>Subject Area: Economic policy; Economic planning; International economics; Trade; Industrial structure; Development studies The project is jointly financed by ESRC, the Committee on Overseas Economic and Social Research of the Overseas Development Administration, and the International Development Research Centre, <ENT>Canada<ENT>. A new generation of middle level developing countries is facing the difficult transition from being exporters of a few traditional commodities and receiving most external finance in the form of official aid to a varied pattern of trade and production, combined with use of more commerical loans or investment. 
Netherlands<SEP>Surrey members congratulate Chris Jones on her display-item for the Reunion - this was her first production; fresh team auditions will be held 29 April. Surrey trainers hope to hold an In-Depth Study Day on Medau in March, to encourage interest in the Training Scheme and in the Society's affairs in general. Manja van Wynkoop was a welcome visitor from the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT> to the Lilleshall Weekend, and renewed Hertfordshire links as guest of Gill Hill's Hemel Hempstead class. Hedi Pressel is reluctantly retiring from teaching Medau in Oxford. 
CYPRUS<SEP>EUROPE <ENT>CYPRUS<ENT> BASIC DATA 
Switzerland<SEP>Espionage convictions A Basel court on March 17, 1989, found a computer specialist guilty of passing economic information to the Soviet Union and sentenced him to 45 days in prison. According to a government report published on Aug. 9, cases of espionage in <ENT>Switzerland<ENT> involving agents from Eastern Europe continued to increase; 65 of the 91 cases recorded from 1980 to 1988 involved these countries, most of which desired technological rather than political or security information, and over the same period 17 of the 24 diplomats and officials expelled were from Eastern Europe. Three Soviet diplomats at the UN secretariat in Geneva were in April 1990 barred from re-entering the country for attempting to collect confidential technological information. 
UK<SEP>Laptop workstations Brite-Lite (from RDI Computer Corp of San Diego) and Tadpole (from Tadpole Technology of Cambridge, <ENT>UK<ENT>) are being distributed by Daishin Electric Co of Tokyo, which also carries a desktop compatible DSSUN Station II based on a 40MHz Sparc, built by US company EOS Technology Inc and released in Japan in October last year; the Tadpole machine just announced arrived at the Daishin booth on the first morning of the show; its beautiful active matrix thin film transistor colour screen, 256 colours, external VGA and Super VGA, manufactured by Sharp Corp attracted attention. 
Germany<SEP>In many countries, people with such strong local roots would long ago have been naturalised as citizens. But in Germany, citizenship depends on ancestry not on place of birth or residence. Very roughly, you are German if your parents are, not because you live in <ENT>Germany<ENT> or were born there. Moreover, the role of the police is in dispute. 
US<SEP>More significantly, the Government yesterday made the biggest effort yet to defuse the row by saying the two Central Office officials' visit had been cleared by the Tory chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, but Major himself had known nothing about it. Clinton is said not to be seeking revenge, but others in his Administration are bitter. A source at the <ENT>US<ENT> Embassy in London dismissed the whole affair as one that has got out of proportion and a diversion from a packed agenda. Even if the Conservative involvement in the US election campaign is pushed into the background, there is plenty of scope on the agenda for disagreement, not least Northern Ireland. 
Italy<SEP>This means that prices have risen considerably over the past few months - a very good reason for looking at alternatives to champagne. What is unique about champagne is the particular combination of soil and grape varieties. The method has been imitated all over the world, in places as diverse as New Zealand, <ENT>Italy<ENT>, Russia, England, California, Australia, Spain and India, and that list is by no means complete. In France, too, sparkling wines made by the méthode tradionelle, as the méthode champenoise is now increasingly called, are widespread. 
Cambodia<SEP>Defence Secretary, Fidel Ramos, says any reports the Philippines two hundred and fifty thousand manned armed forces would oust Aquino, are absurd. He claims dissident soldiers didn't have the ability to launch a coup, but he warned they could mount attacks against government officers and business establishments to cripple the economy. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have agreed on a peace plan that could end more than ten years of civil war in <ENT>Cambodia<ENT>. All five members, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China have at various times, armed and supplied rival factions in Cambodia. 
Britain<SEP>The committee also considered, rather more briefly, the educational needs of Chinese, Cypriot, Italian, Ukrainian and Vietnamese children, and the particular needs of Travellers' children and ` Liverpool Blacks ". The committee's general conclusion was that the response to these issues must lie in the education of all children, not just of ethnic minority children. All LEAs and schools must lead pupils to understand what is involved in <ENT>Britain<ENT>'s being a multiracial and multicultural society; this must permeate all the work of schools. Racism must be fought, and inherited myths and stereotypes attacked. 
Guatemala<SEP>It's educational and good to look at - what more could the kids want (and me too)? Left: The chest of the Marbled Hatchetfish is adapted to give enough power to the large pectoral fins to allow the fish to leap and glide out of and across the surface of the water, to escape from danger. Below: Merry Widows from <ENT>Guatemala<ENT> and Honduras are a live-bearer that makes a change from the standard Guppy, Molly or Swordtail. 
UK<SEP>In the United Kingdom the three large credit reference agencies, Infolink, CCN, and Equifax, hold data on 100 million accounts. While much of their data relates to credit requests and fraud, an increasing amount of information details customer transactions. CCN, for instance, has a database of forty-three million consumers in the <ENT>UK<ENT> which includes information about an individuals creditworthiness, lifestyle, gender, age, and purchasing habits. While this information has potential for contemporary target marketing campaigns, it would be immensely valuable to historians studying late twentieth-century Britain. 
USSR<SEP>In many Latin American countries teachers lack the freedom to devise and organise their own teaching plans, Peru being one of the few exceptions (and even here there is a general curriculum laid down by the ministry). In the Soviet Union, central state control of the curriculum and syllabuses is said to be ` virtually total ". Curricula are devised by the <ENT>USSR<ENT> ministry or a body responsible to it. Contrasting the Soviet and English systems, Muckle points out that traditionally in England the task of working out what subjects should be taught was ` replicated in every school ". 
China<SEP>Concluding talks with Taiwan trade officials on Jan. 24, the French Minister-Delegate for Foreign Trade, Jean-Nöel Jeanneney, announced that direct air links and more formal trade ties would be established, including the setting up of trade offices in Paris and Taipei. He also met the Taiwanese Foreign Affairs Minister, Frederick Chien Fu, during the visit. The Netherlands Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, on Feb. 14 halted a $1,500 million sale of four submarines to Taiwan, which he said would have breached a 1984 accord with <ENT>China<ENT> [ see pp. 33036-37 ]. 
Germany<SEP>The third ministerial-level round of " two-plus-four " talks on German unification was held in Paris on July 17 and reached agreement on the question of the German-Polish border. In discussions on this issue, which Poland also attended [ see pp. 37302-03 for agreement that Poland should do so ], Poland was offered a treaty, to be negotiated immediately following unification, restricted to the issue of the border, with a further treaty, to be negotiated later, to deal with other matters of German-Polish relations. The final " two-plus-four " meeting was to be held in Moscow on Sept. 12 and would produce a formulation for a unification agreement including the termination of " four-power " rights in <ENT>Germany<ENT> prior to the first all-German elections, scheduled for Dec. 2, 1990. EC reactions to unification 
Canada<SEP>Though living chiefly in England, Morris was proud to be Welsh, admiring the Welsh character and abhorring the English class system. He worked to foster Welsh self-confidence in the arts. After failing his examinations to enter the army, he sailed to <ENT>Canada<ENT> and worked on a farm. On his return, he entered the Royal College of Music to study singing, but later turned to art, and in April 1914 he enrolled in the Académie Delacluse in Paris.

Israel<SEP>For the first time Jurnet noticed that one of the Salomes, having caught sight of the bearded gent sitting at the top of the wall with the headless body of the saint draped across his knees, was unmistakably giving God the glad eye. Jurnet laughed aloud, the sound rumbling comfortably round the little church. He felt in his pocket for the postcard from <ENT>Israel<ENT> and promised himself the pleasure of bringing Miriam to Feldon St Awdry the minute she returned to England and he had found out who had killed Professor Max Flaschner. The unpredictability of either consummation in the moderately foreseeable future sobered the detective instantly. 
Georgia<SEP>The congress, in the town of Komrat, was responding to a decision by the Moldavian Supreme Soviet on July 27 to reject proposals to create within Moldavia an autonomous Gagauz republic or region. On Aug. 20 the Moldavian government ruled these secession moves unconstitutional, and two days later it outlawed the Popular Front-style Gagauz Khalky (People's) Movement. The Supreme Soviet in the Abkhaz ASSR voted on Aug. 25 (with barely half of its 140 deputies in attendance) to declare independence from <ENT>Georgia<ENT> and restoration of the full republican status Abkhazia had enjoyed between 1921 and 1930. The declaration accused Georgia of having illegally annexed Abkhazia. 
Saudi Arabia<SEP>possession of detailed knowledge of the issue under negotiation yet able to see the wood for the trees. Politicians and diplomats frequently exhibit these characteristics when dealing with foreign affairs. During the Second World War the King of <ENT>Saudi Arabia<ENT>, Abdul Aziz, managed to convince both the British and the Germans that he was on their side. He did it by carefully keeping his options open and just stopping short of deliberate lying.

Czech Republic<SEP>Pollution Agreement on " Black Triangle " The governments of the <ENT>Czech Republic<ENT>, Germany and Poland have signed an agreement to clean up the " Black Triangle ", the border region of the three countries, which is heavily polluted by emissions from power stations and industrial plants. The three governments will fund specific environmental projects in the region. 
United States<SEP>This means that the final decision-making responsibility is either formally concentrated in one person or, alternatively, in a collective body - a committee - like the British Cabinet, or the Communist Party Politburo in the Soviet Union. In reality, it is often much harder to classify actual systems unambiguously than this simple dichotomy would suggest. For example, the <ENT>United States<ENT> appears to provide a clear example of a single executive - the President. But, after their experiences, as British colonies, with George III's government, the Americans were wary of putting too much power into the hands of one man and, in 1787, discussed the possibility of having two or three coequal presidents. 
India<SEP>The agreement was endorsed by Indian Home Affairs Minister S. B. Chavan, Indian External Affairs Minister Madhavsinh Solanki and Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Minister Harold Herath. About 230,000 Sri Lankan Tamils were in India, while in Sri Lanka there were an estimated 700,000 more people displaced by the war. The majority of the refugees in <ENT>India<ENT> (housed mainly in camps in the states of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Orissa) had fled to escape the violence of 1990-91, after India had abandoned its military involvement and withdrawn the Indian Peace-Keeping Force (IPKF) from the island. The Indian decision to encourage their repatriation reflected the growing problem of crime and violence in the camps. 
Italy<SEP>Second, the enormous increase in international liquidity generated by the exodus from the dollar (see above) meant that the countries which still had weak payments balances could borrow easily. Finally, an unusually large number of major elections took place in 1972. There was a presidential election in the United States, and elections for the principal legislative assemblies in Canada, Germany, <ENT>Italy<ENT> and Japan. Taken together, these economies produce about 70 per cent of OECD output. 
Ireland<SEP>By DAVID LISTER, Arts Correspondent GERARD KELLY, a well-known Belfast mural artist, is to appear in court in New York today in an apparent crackdown on Irish republicans with prison records who enter the US illegally. Mr Kelly, who was expected to paint the portraits of the IRA trio killed by the SAS in Gibraltar and possibly the IRA fugitive Joseph Doherty, was arrested upon arrival from <ENT>Ireland<ENT>. Mr Kelly, 32, who has been fighting deportation from Ireland to Britain for seven years, was invited by a left-wing publishing house to help complete a mural of revolutionary figures whose works and writings it publishes.

Singapore<SEP>Originally thought to be a separate species, the quagga was hunted to extinction last century, but its genes appear to have survived, dispersed among plains zebra. Eleven European nations have concluded an Agreement on the Conservation of Bats, which includes provision for habitat conservation, the control of pesticides, and protection from killing. Indonesian conservationists have reported that at least 1,000 orang-utangs have been smuggled from the country's forests via <ENT>Singapore<ENT> to Taiwan, where they are popular as pets before they grow to adult size. Forty-four of the world's 53 subspecies of Asian hornbills are vulnerable to, or directly facing, extinction because of the loss of their forest habitat, principally due to logging, according to findings presented to a conference in Singapore. 
Nigeria<SEP>Despite the boost to foreign exchange revenue due to recent higher oil prices (total foreign exchange earnings in 1991 were projected at US$11,855 million), the budget was nevertheless adjudged a cautious one, with Babangida stressing strict discipline in its implementation. Gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to rise by 6 per cent, compared with 5.2 per cent in 1990, and a target was set to reduce inflation to 8 per cent by year-end. <ENT>Nigeria<ENT>'s total external debt had risen by 8 per cent to $31,500 million in the year to October 1990, and debt service obligations weighed heavily on federal revenue, some 16,5000 million naira being available for debt servicing within the 1991 revenue and expenditure projections (US$1.00=N8.7506 as at Jan. 14, 1991). Recurrent federal expenditure was budgeted at N12,883 million and federal capital expenditure at N9,240 million. 
Jordan<SEP>International Women's Peace Delegation to Iraq and <ENT>Jordan<ENT> The Delegation was composed of seven women: Margarita Papandreou (Women for Mutual Security, and Global Co-ordinator of the Delegation); myself - Nawal El Saadawi (writer, medical doctor and President of the Arab Women's Solidarity Association); Fatheya Seoudi (Women's Centre, Jordan); Joan Drake (Institute of Policy Studies in Washington and Madrea, Latin America); Maude Barlow (Voice of Women - Canada, Women World Parliamentarians for Peace); Flora Abrachmanova (World Democratic Federation of Women) and Kay Kamp (Women's International League for Peace and Freedom). 
Spain<SEP>Tear gas was used against demonstrators at Brokdorf and Grohnde in West Germany; at Kalkar a moat was dug to keep out an army of protesters. One man was killed when tens of thousands of people gathered at Creys-Malville in France, the site of a new design of ` fast breeder " reactor (see Chapter Three). Even larger numbers opposed an American-style ` light water " reactor being built at Lemoniz in <ENT>Spain<ENT>. One of the most effective mobilizations of public opinion was in Denmark. 
West Bank<SEP>Many Arabs accuse the West of double standards in the Middle East. Iraq is told to obey Security Council Resolution 660 and leave Kuwait at the point of American guns. Israel stays unpunished in the <ENT>West Bank<ENT>, Gaza and the Golan Heights nearly 23 years after Resolution 242 called on it to get out. It sounds unfair - to a visitor just arrived from Mars. 
US<SEP>The mile-long nets hang in the water to a depth of 30 metres (100 feet), forming a much deeper net curtain than the squid and salmon nets of the open ocean. In September 1989, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, one of eight US Regional Fishery Management Councils, voted to prohibit the use of drift-nets for swordfish in southern US Atlantic waters. The Council also urged the New England Fishery Management Council to introduce a similar ban, and called on the <ENT>US<ENT> delegation to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to support a resolution to prohibit the use of drift-nets for all tuna and other species under the jurisdiction of ICCAT. By October 1989, therefore, the time was right for a concerted diplomatic initiative against drift-net fishing. 
Republic of Panama<SEP>Panama was expelled from the Group of Eight in March 1990 [ see p. 37373 ]. POLITICAL SYSTEM The <ENT>Republic of Panama<ENT> seceded from Colombia in 1903 after a revolt encouraged and assisted by the United States. Under the amended Constitution approved in 1983, an executive President is directly elected for a five-year term, as is a unicameral 67-member Legislative Assembly. 
Iceland<SEP>The Council of Europe has remained Western Europe's largest organisation. The original membership of 10 - Belgium, Denmark, France, Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden - had grown to 18 by 1965. Greece and Turkey joined in 1949, <ENT>Iceland<ENT> in 1950, the Federal Republic of Germany in 1951 (with the Saar region, disputed between France and West Germany, having associate status until its reunification with West Germany in 1956), Austria in 1956, Cyprus in 1961, Switzerland in 1963, and Malta in 1965. After the collapse of their authoritarian dictatorships in the mid-1970s, Spain and Portugal were also admitted to membership. 
Britain<SEP>There has been a national style revolution in Britain which has influenced and been influenced by the youth culture of football spectatorship. It follows from the birth of the ` casual " in the 1978-79 football season, after a series of sorties into Europe by fans following teams from Merseyside, Manchester, London, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Italian and other styles were ripped out of their European context when, during the 1980s, it became permissible for young people in <ENT>Britain<ENT>, and most significantly young men, to be interested in fashion on a scale undreamed of in the 60s and the 70s. In the 1990s, British youth culture increasingly looks to a European milieu rather than North America. 
Venezuela<SEP>The US and the Soviet Union would send representatives to both sets of talks. In San Salvador, meanwhile, the FMLN issued a communique setting down its conditions for a truce. The communique, sent to the Central American meeting through <ENT>Venezuela<ENT>'s President Carlos Andres Perez, called for an immediate ceasefire, but demanded that several high-ranking military officers be scrapped and recent anti-terrorist laws be repealed. The rebel terms were immediately rejected. 
South America<SEP>` On a freighter as a deck hand. " ` Smart customer, too. Unless, of course, he was helped all the way - by the same people who got him out of prison and need him in <ENT>South America<ENT>. " Renwick abandoned his cigarette case beside the ashtray, shook his head. 
France<SEP>He spent his youth in Provence where three generations of his family had already devoted themselves to the arcane mysteries of perfume business. The young Guy was introduced to the perfumer's skills by six months in Grasse with first hand experience of the magical ingredients of perfume. As well as the intense flower fragrances of the South of <ENT>France<ENT>, he used cardamom from India and Sri Lanka, the frankincense resin from south Arabia, the rare Yuzu lemon from Japan with its wonderfully refreshing combination of lemon and lime, patchouli, sandalwood and the whole spicy spectrum of Central America. This exotic pot pourri stimulated his own love of natural things and his unquenchable interest in perfumes. 
Australia<SEP>Changes in the environment, most notably switching lights on or off, can entrain the free-running rhythm, bringing it back under outside control. It seems that those external changes are somehow detected by the pineal gland, for experimental animals deprived of their pineal are slower to entrain, but the mechanism is not known. Now, from a team at La Trobe University in Victoria, <ENT>Australia<ENT>, comes evidence that a pineal hormone, melatonin, is responsible for bringing the free-running activity into line with the outside world (Science, vol 219, p 1089). Jenny Redman, Stuart Armstrong and Kim Ng had previously tried injecting rats who were kept in total darkness and free from other environmental signals, with chemicals known to be made in the pineal. 
Kuwait<SEP>Kuwait oil fires From Dr L. Appleby and Prof Roy M. Harrison In view of the predicted climatic perturbations due to smoke produced by a major nuclear exchange, Dr Carty questions whether the burning of oil from <ENT>Kuwait<ENT> wells might contribute significantly to climatic cooling (Chem. Br., 1991, 27, 896). 
Poland<SEP>To my taste, none of these have a particularly distinctive flavour, but the quality in texture is immediately obvious. The best of these sausages are loose or in jars - I find that the necessary temperatures achieved during canning tend to make the sausages rather fatty and slimy in texture. Garlic sausages are made in many countries, notably France, Germany and <ENT>Poland<ENT>. I sell most of the French variety, which is a small sausage with a strong flavour but a coarse and fatty texture. 
US<SEP>A museum of economic botany was opened in 1847, and in later decades Kew played a vital role in the spread of useful plants around the British empire. In the United States a national botanical garden was founded to exploit the seeds and plants brought back by a Pacific exploration expedition under Charles Wilkes in the years 1838-42. At the same time the <ENT>US<ENT> Patent Office became interested in the possibility of using tropical plants to revive the agriculture of the southern states. The Patent Office also promoted the use of chemistry in soil analysis, seeing this as a means of preventing the exhaustion of nutrients. 
Gulf of Mexico<SEP>We will gain further market share by promoting the unique Wimpol package of services to new market sectors and by working in new locations in those regions. We have four key expansion activities ongoing in 1993. We will implement ORION, the worldwide satellite DGPS service, and establish the complementary KU-band regional satellite services in both the North Sea and <ENT>Gulf of Mexico<ENT>. We will thus address profitably both local and global navigation market opportunities in addition to our mainstream precise positioning markets. 
Georgia<SEP>Bush said that he would be willing to lift US sanctions once the Pretoria government had fulfilled conditions including the total lifting of the state of emergency. Earlier, Mandela had been forthright in his criticism of US support for the Angolan rebel movement UNITA [ see p. 37523 ]. In the course of his visit Mandela addressed Congress and travelled to other US cities which had taken a strong anti-apartheid stance, including Atlanta, <ENT>Georgia<ENT>, where he visited the tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther King. Mandela had what was by all accounts a successful meeting with the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on July 4, describing her afterwards as an " enemy of apartheid ". 
UK<SEP>Boyden followed Spencer Stuart in 1965-6 but has suffered varying business fortunes since then. Few of Boyden's early British headhunters have survived to the present, and its level of business declined and failed to take off significantly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. For instance, during 1979, with three consultants only 30 placements were achieved in the <ENT>UK<ENT>, compared with Egon Zehnder's 80 and Spencer Stuart's 170 in the same year. The number of placements had marginally increased by 1981 to 40. 
Netherlands<SEP>Offshore companies are exempt from exchange controls and withholding tax. Offshore non-trading companies are exempt from corporation tax, but may waive their exemption and pay tax at an agreed rate. This may be beneficial if it enables them to take advantage of the participation exemption available in countries such as the <ENT>Netherlands<ENT> or France. Offshore trading companies are liable to pay tax at a rate of 5%.
